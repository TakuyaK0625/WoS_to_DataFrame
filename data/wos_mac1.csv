The hydrophilic natural clay mineral, allophane, can further enhanced such properties. Titania and/or allophane nanoparticle-dispersing titania films were layered on glass plates by a simple sol gel process. The influences of the allophane amount and thickness of the allophane-dispersing layer of the nanocomposite films on the hydrophilicity, water absorptivity, and water retentivity were investigated by measuring the contact angle of a water droplet, FTIR spectroscopy, and UV-Vis spectroscopy using a dye molecular probe. The hydrophilicity was enhanced by the UV irradiation and the allophane dispersion. The allophane nanoparticles also effectively increased the water absorptivity and retentivity. The FTIR spectra of the adsorbed water and UV-Vis spectra of the deposited dye were more suitable for the hydrophilicity evaluation of the film's inside and surface, respectively, because the water molecules can penetrate deeper into the inside of the film (water absorption) than the dye molecules. The temperature on the film surface successfully decreased with increases in the irradiation time and the thickness of the allophane-dispersing layer due to the enhancement of the water retentivity of the film's inside by the endothermal process of water vaporization.","[Nishikiori, Hiromasa; Watanabe, Mizuki; Nakase, Miku; Kikuchi, Ayaka; Yamakami, Tomohiko; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nishikiori, Hiromasa; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, RISM, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Nishikiori, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",nishiki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP15K05472, JP16KK0110]","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) Grant Numbers JP15K05472 and JP16KK0110.",,34,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0926-3373,1873-3883,,APPL CATAL B-ENVIRON,Appl.

We studied the effect of preparation conditions, including GO:Fe3+ molar ratio and reduction temperature, on the structure and electromagnetic wave absorption properties of the nanocomposites. The Fe3O4 rGO nanocomposites have a typical sandwich structure at a 1:1 M ratio. Increasing the reduction temperature above 500 degrees C yielded a relatively pure Fe3O4 crystalline phase. Furthermore, changes in the microstructure effectively influence the matching performance of the material. A reasonable molar ratio and reduction temperature yields a composite with improved impedance matching and thickness matching characteristics. M a ratio of 1:1 and reduction temperature of 600 degrees C, the actual matching thickness of the material conforms to the quarter-wavelength theory, and the input impedance of the material matches the air impedance. As a result, electromagnetic waves enter the interior of the composite unhindered, where they can be effectively attenuated, thereby further improving the wave absorption properties of the material. When the thickness is 3 mm, the maximum reflectance at 8.6 GHz reaches -49.6 dB with an effective bandwidth of 2.72 GHz.","[Cai, Yingying; Sun, Qilong; Sun, Lei; Long, Xiaoyun; Ji, Tao; Ye, Wei] Nantong Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Tech Fiber Compos, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Yingying; Sun, Qilong; Sun, Lei; Long, Xiaoyun; Ji, Tao; Ye, Wei] Nantong Univ, Coll Text & Clothing, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sun, Lei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Ye, W (reprint author), Nantong Univ, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Tech Fiber Compos, Nantong 226019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yewei@ntu.edu.cn,,,Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions [192]; Graduate Innovation Project of Nantong University College of Textiles and Clothing [FZ201802],"This study was supported by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (Su Caijiao [2018] No. 192), and the Graduate Innovation Project of Nantong University College of Textiles and Clothing (FZ201802).",,20,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-8853,1873-4766,,J MAGN MAGN MATER,J.

However, low carbon solubility in the TSSG method prevents rapid growth of bulk SiC single crystals. In this study, we propose cobalt (Co), for the first-ever use in this method, with the aim of improving the SiC growth rate and crystal quality realized through the TSSG method with a Si0.6Cr0.4 solvent. The surface morphology of crystals grown with the Si0.6Cr0.4 solvent was characterized by significant step bunching. However, the growth surface generated by a Si0.6Cr0.4Co0.04 solvent was characterized by a smooth surface with step-flow growth, and the crystal grown with this solvent contained almost no Co. Furthermore, the growth rate in the Si0.6Cr0.4Co0.04 solvent was three times higher than that in the Si0.6Cr0.4 solvent. Based on the aforementioned results, Si0.6Cr0.4Co0.04 represents a promising solvent that can be used to enhance the growth rate and improve the quality of SiC single crystals.","[Hyun, Koangyong] Mokpo Maritime Univ, Div Naval Officer Sci, Mokpo 58628, Jeonnam, South Korea; [Kim, Seong-Jong] Mokpo Natl Maritime Univ, Div Marine Engn, Mokpo, South Korea; [Taishi, Toshinori] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Taishi, Toshinori] Shinshu Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Sci, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Taishi, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",taishi@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,Super Cluster Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST),Part of this research was financially supported by the Super Cluster Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

The ZnO-HT-PAN_H showed better dye-removing or antibacterial results in comparison with using either zinc oxide or HT embedded in PAN nanofibers. The resulted PAN nanofibers containing mere ZnO were proved to be holding nanoparticles loosely, which was undesirable for dye removal on account of the irretrievable distribution of particles into the liquid environment. With the gluing effect of HT, ZnO nanoparticles were bound together and thus the dye adsorption was improved. In the present study, all samples were characterized by SEM-EDS, TEM, FTIR, XRD, XPS, tensile testing, and water contact angle. The antibacterial properties were assessed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, presenting superior inhibition zones, revealing the synergistic actions of HT and zinc oxide. The dye removing effects, evaluated against reactive blue 19 and reactive red 195 throughout 26 h, also exhibited improved adsorption without leaching phenomena. The maximum adsorption capacity of ZnO-HT-PAN_H was 267.37 and 245.76 mg/g for RB 19 and RR 195, respectively.

However, their ECL efficiency dramatically decreases in the aqueous solution compared to that in organic phase, which significantly limits their applications in bioanalysis. In this study, we developed a new sensing strategy via the combination of a closed bipolar electrode and electrochemiluminescence (CBP-ECL) system, which allows the separation of sensing in aqueous media and generation of ECL in organic media. Two kinds of QDs, CdSe/ZnS and CsPbBr3 were applied as ECL fluorophores in this system, and stable, high QYs ECL signals were achieved. The resulting sensing platform demonstrated high sensitivity for the detection of H2O2 with a linear range of 0.02-12 mM and the limit of detection (LOD) of 9.2 x 10(-8) M when CdSe/ZnS QDs were used as ECL reagents. We envision that this system can be widely employed in any kind of bioanalysis which can produce the electrochemical currents in the detecting cell. More importantly, we expect this system could break through the limitation of the fluorophores, especially those with solvent dependent ECL signals such as aggregation-induced emission (AIE) molecules, or most of the hydrophobic dyes.","[Zhao, Wenyuan; Ma, Ying; Ye, Jianshan] South China Univ Technol, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Fuel Cell Technol Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Jin, Jiye] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Ma, Y; Ye, JS (reprint author), South China Univ Technol, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Fuel Cell Technol Guangdong Prov, Guangzhou 510641, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Jin, JY (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",maying@scut.edu.cn; jsye@scut.edu.cn; jin@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Ma, Ying/0000-0003-2204-0663","Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province [2019A1515011983, 2019B020219002, 2018A050506006]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [21875070, 21974052]","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (Nos. 2019A1515011983, 2019B020219002, 2018A050506006), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 21875070, 21974052).",,44,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",,0925-4005,,SENSOR ACTUAT B-CHEM,Sens.

Limb salvage was poorer in the DG (79% vs 89%, P = .0061). No significant difference was observed in mortality, amputation-free survival (AFS), and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Multivariate analysis revealed diabetes status, infection, poor activity of daily living (ADL), younger age, and procedure failure as independent predictors of major amputation in DG. In the NDG, procedure failure was the predictor, and younger age and poor ADL showed tendency of major amputation. Conclusions: Mortality, AFS, and TVR showed no significant difference between the 2 groups, but major amputation was more frequent in DG. Not only revascularization but also infection and diabetes control were very important for limb salvage in DG.","[Suzuki, Kenji; Inoue, Naoto; Meguro, Taiichiro] Sendai Kousei Hosp, Cardiovasc Ctr, Aoba Ku, 4-15 Hirosemachi, Sendai, Miyagi 9800873, Japan; [Iida, Osamu] Kansai Rosai Hosp, Cardiovasc Div, Amagasaki, Hyogo, Japan; [Yamauchi, Yasutaka] Kikuna Mem Hosp, Cardiovasc Ctr, Kohoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Nakano, Masatsugu] Saiseikai Yokohama City Eastern Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Tsurumi Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Soga, Yoshimitsu] Kokura Mem Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Kita Ku, Kibune Cho, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kawasaki, Daizo] Hyogo Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Cardiovasc Div, Mukogawa Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan; [Tazaki, Junichi] Kyoto Univ Hosp, Dept Circulatory Organs, Sakyo Ku, Kawahara Cho, Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan; [Yamaoka, Terutoshi] Matsuyama Red Cross Hosp, Dept Vasc Surg, Bunkyo Cho, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Suematsu, Nobuhiro] Japanese Red Cross Fukuoka Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Minami Ku, Okusu Cho, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Shintani, Yoshiaki] Shin Koga Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Tenjin Cho, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan; [Miyashita, Yusuke] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Adv PAD Therapeut, Asahi Ku, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Suzuki, K (reprint author), Sendai Kousei Hosp, Cardiovasc Ctr, Aoba Ku, 4-15 Hirosemachi, Sendai, Miyagi 9800873, Japan.",k-y.suzuki@nifty.com,,,,,,22,3,3,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0003-3197,1940-1574,,ANGIOLOGY,Angiology,MAY,2020,71,5,,,,,444,451,,10.1177/0003319713499606,,,8,Peripheral Vascular Disease,Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,LA1RY,WOS:000523733400008,23966570,,,,2020/4/20

In an in situ electron microscopy experiment, where the objects are exposed to laser pulses during their observation, the amorphization of iron and cobalt nanocrystals in graphitic shells is demonstrated. The infrared nanosecond pulses lead to fast melting of the metal which then dissolves carbon atoms from the shell. Fast cooling of the liquid solution after the pulse results in the solidification of an amorphous metal-carbon phase. The amorphous phase is metastable and can be recrystallized by repeated laser pulses or slow thermal annealing. The recrystallization needs heterogeneous nucleation but is unfavorable at the metal-graphite interface and so stabilizes the amorphous phase against recrystallization. The analysis of the experiments explains the formation mechanisms of an amorphous metal-carbon phase as a metastable solution of carbon in a transition metal and shows how that the encapsulation by a graphitic shell can be a route towards the stabilization of otherwise unfavorable amorphous metal or metal-carbon phases.

These animals fulfill key ecological functions and provide important services to humans. Unfortunately, populations have declined dramatically over the last century, rendering Unionidae one of the world's most imperiled taxonomic groups. In Far East Asia (comprising Japan, Korea, and Eastern Russia), conservation actions have been hindered by a lack of basic information on the number, identity, distribution and phylogenetic relationships of species. Available knowledge is restricted to studies on national and sub-national levels. The present study aims to resolve the diversity, biogeography and evolutionary relationships of the Far East Asian Unionidae in a globally comprehensive phylogenetic and systematic context. We reassessed the systematics of all Unionidae species in the region, including newly collected specimens from across Japan, South Korea, and Russia, based on molecular (including molecular species delineation and a COI + 28S phylogeny) and comparative morphological analyses. Biogeographical patterns were then assessed based on available species distribution data from the authors and previous reference works. We revealed that Unionidae species richness in Far East Asia is 30% higher than previously assumed, counting 43 species (41 native + 2 alien) within two Unionidae subfamilies, the Unioninae (32 + 1) and Gonideinae (9 + 1). Four of these species are new to science, i.e. Beringiana gosannensis sp. nov., Beringiana fitkuharai sp. nov., Buldowskia kamiyai sp. nov., and Koreosolenaia sitgyensis gen. & sp. nov. We also propose a replacement name for Nodularia sinulata, i.e. Nodularia breviconcha nom. nov. and describe a new tribe (Middendorffinaiini tribe nov.) within the tlnioninae subfamily. Biogeographical patterns indicate that this fauna is related to that from China south to Vietnam until the Mekong River basin. The Japanese islands of Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Hokkaido, and the Korean Peninsula were identified as areas of particularly high conservation value, owing to high rates of endemism, diversity and habitat loss. The genetically unique species within the genera Anturanodonta, Obovalis, Koreosolenaia gen. nov., and Middendorffinaia are of high conservation concern.","[Lopes-Lima, Manuel; Goncalves, Duarte, V] Univ Porto, CIBIO InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, Campus Agr Vairao, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal;

In particular, elastic valves using AC electroosmosis (ACEO) hold promise for the development of artificial cilia in future microfluidic applications because of their simplicity and high-performance multi-functionality. However, direct evidence of ACEO-driven large valving motion has not been obtained yet. In this study, we report experiments that a wide Au-coated plastic-film beam shows large valving motion in water. By visualizing the flow fields during the motion, we show that the large valving motion of the wide Au-coated beam is understood to be due to ACEO occurring at the edge of the beam. Furthermore, we found that the wide beam was elevated largely by the effect of the vortex flow (understood to be the flow due to ACEO at the beam edge) and the incoming lift flow into the rearward region of the valve. We believe that our findings contribute significantly to realizing new artificial cilia.","[Sugioka, Hideyuki; Mizuno, Yuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Sugioka, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",hsugioka@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,PHYSICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"YUSHIMA URBAN BUILDING 5F, 2-31-22 YUSHIMA, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0034, JAPAN",0031-9015,,,J PHYS SOC JPN,J.

In the work reported here, we investigated the relationship between M1 seed-based rs-FC and motor learning. Fifty-three healthy volunteers undertook random button-press and sequential motor learning tasks. Five-minute resting-state data acquisition was performed between the two tasks. Oscillatory neural activities during the random task and the rest period were measured using magnetoencephalography. M1 seed-based rs-FC was calculated for the alpha and beta bands using amplitude envelope correlation, in which the seed location was defined as an M1 position with peak event-related desynchronization value. The relationship between rs-FC and the performance of motor learning was examined using whole brain correlation analysis. The results showed that beta-band resting-state cross-network connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the core network, particularly the theory of mind network, affected the performance of subsequent motor learning tasks. Good learners could be distinguished from poor learners by the strength of rs-FC between the M1 and the left superior temporal gyrus, a part of the theory of mind network. These results suggest that cross-network connectivity between the sensorimotor network and the theory of mind network can be used as a predictor of motor learning performance.","[Sugata, Hisato; Kawakami, Kenji; Kawakami, Keisuke] Oita Univ, Fac Welf & Hlth Sci, 700 Dannoharu, Oita 8701192, Japan; [Yagi, Kazuhiro] Junwakai Mem Hosp, Dept Clin Lab, Miyazaki, Japan; [Yazawa, Shogo; Tsuruta, Kazuhito] Junwakai Mem Hosp, Dept Neurol, Miyazaki, Japan; [Nagase, Yasunori] Junwakai Mem Hosp, Dept Rehabil, Miyazaki, Japan; [Ikeda, Takashi] Kanazawa Univ, Res Ctr Child Mental Dev, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Nojima, Ippei] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Fac Hlth Sci, Nagano, Japan; [Hara, Masayuki] Saitama Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Saitama, Japan; [Matsushita, Kojiro] Gifu Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Gifu, Japan","Sugata, H (reprint author), Oita Univ, Fac Welf & Hlth Sci, 700 Dannoharu, Oita 8701192, Japan.",hsugata@oita-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K16429, 18H03132]","This work was supported by a grant for KAKENHI (16K16429, 18H03132) grants funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

The PEI nanoparticles were not perfectly spherical, but were pie shaped as observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Thus, the PEI nanoparticles were adsorbed on the CF surface instead of accumulating on the CF surface. To understand the effect of PEI nanoparticles on the interfacial shear strength between CF and thermoplastic resins, CF with a PEI nanoparticle coating was heated to melt the PEI nanoparticles. In addition to the desized CF, these three samples were used as reinforcements and some widely used engineering thermoplastic resins. The single filament fragmentation test was employed to assess the interfacial shear strength with an improved sample preparation process. The results show that the introduction of PEI coating increased the interfacial shear strength between CF and the thermoplastic resins mentioned above, especially the surface of the PEI coating used a nanoparticle morphology. In combination with the hot-bonding experiments, the compatibility of thermoplastic resins and PEI coating was shown to influence interfacial shear strength, but it was not the main factor.","[Zhu, Peng] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Mat & Text, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Peng; Bao, Limin] Shinshu Univ, Dept Biosci & Text Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Shi, Jian] Akita Prefectural Univ, Fac Syst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, 84-4 Ebinokuchi, Yurihonjo, Akita 0150055, Japan","Zhu, P (reprint author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Mat & Text, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhupeng@zstu.edu.cn,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province, ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LQ20E030001]; Research Initiation Fund Project from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University [18012278-Y]","This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province, China (Grant No. LQ20E030001) and Research Initiation Fund Project from Zhejiang Sci-Tech University (Grant No. 18012278-Y).",,26,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0169-4332,1873-5584,,APPL SURF SCI,Appl.

Thiol was incorporated onto the surface of cellulose nanofibers, which were fabricated by the deacetylation of electrospun cellulose acetate nanofibers and subsequent esterification of a thiol precursor molecule. Adsorption mechanism was investigated using adsorption isotherms. Adsorption capacity as a function of adsorbate concentration was described well with Langmuir isotherm, suggesting that metal ions form a surface monolayer with a homogenously distributed adsorption energy. Maximum adsorption capacities in the Langmuir isotherm for Cu(II), Cd(II), and Pb(II) ions were 49.0, 45.9, and 22.0 mg.g(-1), respectively. The time-dependent adsorption capacities followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, suggesting that chemisorption of each doubly charged metal ion occurs with two thiol groups on the surface. These results highlight the significance of surface functionality on biocompatible, nontoxic, and sustainable cellulose materials to expand their potential and applicability towards water remediation applications.","[Choi, Hyeong Yeol; Bae, Jong Hyuk; Lee, Hoik] Korea Inst Ind Technol, Res Inst Ind Technol Convergence, Smart Text R&D Grp, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Choi, Hyeong Yeol] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Adv Organ Mat & Text Syst Engn, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Bae, Jong Hyuk] Hanyang Univ, Dept Organ & Nano Engn, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Hasegawa, Yohei; Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Div Frontier Fibers, Inst Fiber Engn IFES,ICCER, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [An, Sol; Kim, Myungwoong] Inha Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea","Lee, H (reprint author), Korea Inst Ind Technol, Res Inst Ind Technol Convergence, Smart Text R&D Grp, Ansan 15588, South Korea.; Kim, IS (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Div Frontier Fibers, Inst Fiber Engn IFES,ICCER, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Kim, M (reprint author), Inha Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp; hoik@kitech.re.kr; mkim233@inha.ac.kr,"Kim, Myungwoong/AAK-9052-2020","Kim, Myungwoong/0000-0003-0611-8694",National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korea government (Ministry of Education) [2018R1D1A1B07044345],We gratefully acknowledge the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grants funded by the Korea government (Ministry of Education) (Grant No. 2018R1D1A1B07044345).,,48,0,0,39,39,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-8617,1879-1344,,CARBOHYD POLYM,Carbohydr.

In this study, a novel simple method to remove pollutants from water by a freeze-thaw procedure using a syringe, elastic band and cotton wool has been developed. The solution (20 mL) containing an environmental pollutant, Cr(VI), Pb(II), F- , NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, pentachlorophenol, or Congo Red, was added to a syringe separately. The part around the outlet of the syringe was covered with cotton wool and held in place with an elastic band. The syringe was then frozen in a typical freezer. The cotton wool around the syringe plays a role to control the place of the pollutants in the frozen solution. The frozen sample was thawed at room temperature. The pollutant was concentrated in the initial fraction of the thawing solution. The fraction (1 mL) was sampled, and the rest was fully thawed and frozen again. The treatment was repeated 3 times. As a result, the concentration of Cr(VI), Pb(II), F-, NO3-, NO2-, PO43-, pentachlorophenol, or Congo Red, in the final solutions was 0.24, 0.13, 0.20, 0.20, 0.23, 0.25, 0.25 or 0.22 mM, respectively (the initial concentration of the pollutants was 1.0 mM).

The streamwise and transverse velocities were measured with hot-wire anemometry using an X-type probe. The mean velocity field and the velocity covariances were first characterised to assess the undisturbed flow field. Periodic excitations were introduced from a slot mounted at the channel exit and the coherent fluctuating part of the signal was obtained by using a phase-locked averaging technique, where the periodic initial forcing was used as trigger. This enabled the eduction of the coherent structure associated with the introduced perturbation. Its amplitude was found to be directly proportional to the intensity of the initial forcing and, within a certain range of the initial forcing amplitude, the growth curves were identical as well as the spatial distribution of the extracted fluctuations. Parallel and non-parallel linear stability theory captures qualitatively and quantitatively the features of the educed coherent structure. The existence of the linear mode in the turbulent jet implies that the large-scale perturbations observed in natural (unforced) jets can be regarded as an incoherent set of linear modes.","[Matsubara, Masaharu] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Wakasato 4-17-1, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Alfredsson, P.

Methods: The study was performed as a nonrandomized controlled study undergoing primary Nuss procedure at our institute from 2016 to 2018. We evaluated 34 patients and assigned them to two groups based on whether or not they received a respiratory rehabilitation. Group A (between June 2016 and March 2018) includes patients with inspiratory training postoperatively, and group B (between April 2018 and July 2018) includes patients without training. At the time of admission, a physiatrist provided each patient with a training instruction. From day five postoperatively, the patients in group A started training for inspiration with an incentive spirometer (Coach 2 (R) PORTEX) four times a day. Patients were instructed to perform the same training at home after discharge. Using this device, we measured pre- and postoperative inspired volumes in each group. Data were analyzed with Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests and a paired Student t-test. A p-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups concerning both operative age and the degree of the deformity calculated by Haller index. Preoperative inspiratory volume showed no significant differences. Although there were no statistical differences between two groups in the inspiratory volume at discharge, these two parameters were significantly higher in group A after three months postoperatively (A: 1404 +/- 466 ml vs B: 900 +/- 314 ml) and the values increased compared to the preoperative stage in group A. Conclusions: These data indicate the aggressive respiratory rehabilitation is an effective regimen to increase inspiratory volume at an early stage after Nuss procedure. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

For comparison, we have also synthesized a long alkyl-chain-substituted liquid crystal (m-C20OPhO)(8)PcCu (7o) having the same phthalocyanine core with long alkyl chains in the periphery. Each of the derivatives 5-M and 7o showed a hexagonal ordered columnar (Col(ho)) mesophase. Very interestingly, the halo positions in the X-ray diffraction patterns for the Col(ho) mesophases of the flying-seed-like liquid crystals 5-M and the long alkyl-chain-substituted liquid crystal 7o were quite differently given at 5.7-6.2 angstrom and 4.6-4.7 angstrom, respectively. The halo positions of the representative derivatives 5-Cu and 7o having the same copper phthalocyanine (PcCu) core were finely measured at various temperatures by using the temperature-variable small angle X-ray diffraction technique. As the result, the derivatives 5-Cu and 7o showed sudden jumps of halo position from 5.5 to 5.7 angstrom and from 4.2 to 4.6 angstrom, respectively, at the phase transition from the crystalline phase to the liquid crystalline phase (Col(ho)). This means that the volume changes (Delta V) corresponding to these halo jumps originate from two different kinds of mechanisms by sudden free rotation of the bulky substituents and by sudden melting of the long alkyl chains.

The spatial orientation of STAS cells in the lung alveolar parenchyma is not known. The aim of this study was to use high-resolution and high-quality three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of images from immunohistochemical (IHC) and multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) experiments to understand the spatial architecture of tumor cell clusters by STAS in the lung parenchyma. Methods: Four lung adenocarcinomas, three micropapillary-predominant and one solid predominant adenocarcinoma subtypes, were investigated. A 3D reconstruction image was created from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks. A total of 350 serial sections were obtained and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (100 slides), IHC (200 slides), and multiplex IF staining (50 slides) with the following antibodies: cluster of differentiation 31, collagen type IV, thyroid transcription factor-1, and E-cadherin. Whole slide images were reconstructed into 3D images for evaluation. Results: Serial 3D image analysis by hematoxylin and eosin, IHC, and IF staining revealed that the micropapillary clusters and solid nests of STAS are focally attached to the alveolar walls, away from the main tumor. Conclusions: Our 3D reconstructions found that STAS tumor cells can attach to the alveolar walls rather than appearing free floating, as seen on the two-dimensional sections. This suggests that the tumor cells detach from the main tumor, migrate through air spaces, and reattach to the alveolar walls through vessel co-option, allowing them to survive and grow. This may explain the higher recurrence rate and worse survival of patients with STAS-positive tumors who undergo limited resection than those who undergo lobectomy.

Some hydromorphic paleosols were formed in the proximal floodplain and the natural levee, which are generally located in a high-topographic position, and these paleosols finally reached a similar maturity to ultisol and inceptisol. The vertical variation of the sedimentary fades suggests the increased sedimentation rates and increased volume of sediment supply during this period. The stratigraphic distribution of the hydromorphic paleosols in the Pliocene formation implies the rising of the paleo-groundwater table and to become considerably fluctuating of the paleo-groundwater table.

Various pore sizes of PEVA/BPO porous foam were obtained using different NaCl particle sizes. The PEVA/BPO foams with various pore sizes exhibited reversible shape changes that allowed contraction during cooling and expansion during heating. The ideal two-way shape memory performance can be clearly observed in the large pore size sample PEVA/BPO-450. The morphology was characterized by scanning electron micron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray microcomputed tomography scanning (mu CT) analysis. The compression behavior of PEVA/BPO foam was also investigated. These properties of two-way reversible shape memory PEVA/BPO foams could qualify their use as lightweight porous actuators in artificial intelligence and aerospace applications.

This article offers the perspectives of the challenges and opportunities in the production of these chemicals, focusing on the roles of catalysis in more sustainable, alternative production methods that minimize energy consumption and environmental impact. While not intended to be a comprehensive review, the article provides a critical review of selected literature relevant to its objectives, discusses areas needed for further research, and potential new directions inspired by new developments in related fields.

When cyanocobalamin (10 mu mol/L) was treated with these compounds, hypochlorous acid water (an effective chlorine concentration of 30 ppm) rapidly reacted with cyanocobalamin. The maximum absorptions at 361 and 550 nm completely disappeared by 1 h, and vitamin B-12 activity was lost. There were no significant changes observed in the absorption spectra of cyanocobalamin for 0.01% (w/v) sodium metabisulfite; however, a small amount of the reaction product was formed within 48 h, which was subsequently identified as sulfitocobalamin through high-performance liquid chromatography. Similar results were shown for sodium sulfite. The effects of these food additives on the vitamin B-12 content of red shrimp and beef meats were determined, revealing no significant difference in vitamin B-12 content of shrimp and beef meats with or without the treatment even in hypochlorous acid water. The results suggest that these food additives could not react with food vitamin B-12 in food, as most of this vitamin present in food is its protein-bound form rather than the free form.","[Okamoto, Naho; Bito, Tomohiro; Ishihara, Atsushi; Yabuta, Yukinori; Watanabe, Fumio] Tottori Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Tottori, Tottori 6808553, Japan; [Bito, Tomohiro; Hiura, Nanami; Yamamoto, Ayaka; Iida, Mayu; Baba, Yasuhiro; Ishihara, Atsushi; Yabuta, Yukinori; Watanabe, Fumio] Tottori Univ, Fac Agr, Sch Agr Biol & Environm Sci, Tottori, Tottori 6808553, Japan; [Fujita, Tomoyuki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Agr & Life Sci, Nagano 3994598, Japan","Watanabe, F (reprint author), Tottori Univ, United Grad Sch Agr Sci, Tottori, Tottori 6808553, Japan.; Watanabe, F (reprint author), Tottori Univ, Fac Agr, Sch Agr Biol & Environm Sci, Tottori, Tottori 6808553, Japan.",watanabe@muses.tottori-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K07736]",This work was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 16K07736 (F.W.).,,31,0,0,0,0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2470-1343,,,ACS OMEGA,ACS Omega,24-Mar,2020,5,11,,,,,6207,6214,,10.1021/acsomega.0c00425,,,8,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Chemistry,KX3LI,WOS:000521782400072,32226906,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

This study introduces an approach to simultaneously load two redox cocatalysts, atomically dispersed cobalt for improving oxidation activity and anthraquinone for improving reduction selectivity, onto graphitic carbon nitride (C3N4) nanosheets for photocatalytic H2O2 production. Spatial separation of oxidative and reductive cocatalysts was achieved on a two-dimensional (2D) photocatalyst, by coordinating cobalt single atom above the void center of C3N4 and anchoring anthraquinone at the edges of C3N4 nanosheets. Such spatial separation, experimentally confirmed and computationally simulated, was found to be critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This center/edge strategy for spatial separation of cocatalysts may be applied on other 2D photo-catalysts that are increasingly studied in photosynthetic reactions.","[Chu, Chiheng; Zhu, Qianhong; Huang, Dahong; Weon, Seunghyun; Kim, Jae-Hong] Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Pan, Zhenhua; Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Gupta, Srishti; Muhich, Christopher] Arizona State Univ, Sch Engn Matter Transport & Energy, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA; [Du, Yonghua; Stavitski, Eli] Brookhaven Natl Lab, Natl Synchrotron Light Source 2, Upton, NY 11973 USA; [Wu, Yueshen] Yale Univ, Dept Chem, 225 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Kim, JH (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",jaehong.kim@yale.edu,,"Weon, Seunghyun/0000-0003-4529-8069; , Chiheng/0000-0001-9493-9120","National Science Foundation (NSF) Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water TreatmentNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EEC-1449500]; Early Postdoctoral Mobility Fellowship, Swiss National Science FoundationSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P2EZP2_168796]; China Scholarship CouncilChina Scholarship Council; DOE Office of ScienceUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DESC0012704]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [ACI-1548562]","This work was partially supported by National Science Foundation (NSF) Nanosystems Engineering Research Center for Nanotechnology-Enabled Water Treatment (Grant EEC-1449500).

A transparent Ta3N5 photoanode embedded within a PEC cell having a tandem configuration is a promising configuration that may provide a high solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency. Ta3N5 thin films are typically prepared by heating precursor films in an NH3 flow at high temperatures, which tends to degrade the transparent conductive layer, such that producing efficient Ta3N5 transparent photoanodes is challenging. Herein, the direct preparation of transparent Ta3N5 photoanodes on insulating quartz substrates was demonstrated without the insertion of a transparent conductive layer. The resulting devices generated a photocurrent of 6.0 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode under simulated sunlight. This study provides a new strategy for the preparation of transparent photoelectrodes that mitigates current challenges.","[Higashi, Tomohiro; Otsuka, Yuki; Kawase, Yudai; Katayama, Masao; Minegishi, Tsutomu; Takanabe, Kazuhiro] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Nishiyama, Hiroshi; Otsuka, Yuki; Yamada, Taro; Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Off Univ Professors, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Nakabayashi, Mamiko; Shibata, Naoya] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Res Initiat Supramat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808533, Japan","Domen, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Off Univ Professors, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.; Domen, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Res Initiat Supramat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808533, Japan.",domen@chemsys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Artificial Photosynthesis Project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19K15670]",The authors are grateful to Dr. Y.

Host shifting to closely related plant species is thought to play an important role in phytophagous insect diversification, but the extent to which other interactions such as mutualistic associations affect diversification is not yet known. In this study, we reconstructed the molecular phylogeny of Japanese Stomaphis aphids and determined whether host shifting or mutualistic association with different ant species could explain diversification in this aphid genus. We analyzed 12 species of Stomaphis and grouped them into ten well-supported DNA lineages. Species in each lineage used a single or a few host plant species, but were mutualistically associated with many ant species of the genus Lasius. This result suggests that Stomaphis evolutionarily diversified primarily through host plant shifts. Interestingly, the reconstructed phylogeny suggests that Stomaphis host shifts occasionally occurred between very distantly related host plant taxa (spanning up to five plant orders). The dependence of Stomaphis on long-lasting Lasius ant colonies situated in temperate deciduous forests where Lasius is the dominant ant genus may have led the aphids to shift to distantly related but spatially adjacent host tree species.","[Yamamoto, Tetsuya] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Nagano, Japan; [Hattori, Mitsuru] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Fisheries & Environm Sci, Nagasaki, Japan; [Matsumoto, Yoshiyuki] Kashiwa Jr & Senior High Sch, Shibaura Inst Technol, Chiba, Japan; [Ueda, Shouhei] Osaka Prefecture Univ, Grad Sch Life & Environm Sci, Osaka, Japan; [Itino, Takao] Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Nagano, Japan","Yamamoto, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Nagano, Japan.",8mate2@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science: KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26291090, 16J09182]",This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for a Research Fellow from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science: KAKENHI Grant No. 26291090 to T Itino and No. 16J09182 to T Yamamoto.,,62,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0028-1042,1432-1904,,SCI NAT-HEIDELBERG,Sci.

The goal of this study was to clarify the limitations and problems with spinal corrective surgery with minimally invasive lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) without osteotomy using GAP score, and to establish a preoperative radiographical evaluation to understand the necessity for three-column osteotomy. Methods We included data from 57 consecutive patients treated with spinal corrective surgery with LLIF and without Schwab grade 3-6 osteotomy for ASD. To evaluate flexibility of the pelvis and lumbar spine, we examined full-length lateral radiographs with patients standing and prone. Correlations between pre- and postoperative radiographic parameters and GAP score were determined. Results Most patients achieved a sufficiently ideal lumbar lordosis (87.7%), but ideal sacral slope (SS) was achieved in only 50.8% of patients. Preoperative prone SS showed a significant positive correlation with postoperative SS and a significant negative correlation with GAP score. Patients whose preoperative prone SS was larger than pelvic incidence x 0.59-7.5 tended to achieve proportioned spinopelvic alignment by using LLIF. Conclusions The cause of poor outcome of GAP score for ASD corrective surgery with LLIF without osteotomy is a postoperative small SS. Preoperative prone SS is useful for predicting postoperative SS. When preoperative SS in prone patients is relatively small to ideal as calculated using PI, osteotomy or other correctors should be considered to achieve satisfactory spinopelvic parameters.

The Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA) is a leading assessment tool for hand OA-related functional impairment. Our objective was to make a Japanese version of FIHOA (J-FIHOA) and validate it among Japanese hand OA patients.MethodsForward and backward translation processes were completed to create a culturally adapted J-FIHOA. A prospective, observational multicenter study was undertaken for the validation process. Seventeen collaborating hospitals recruited Japanese hand OA patients who met the American College of Rheumatology criteria. A medical record review and responses to the following patient-rated questionnaires were collected: J-FIHOA, Hand20, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), numerical rating scale for pain (NRS pain) and Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). We explored the structure of J-FIHOA using factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha coefficients and item-total correlations were calculated. Correlations between J-FIHOA and other questionnaires were evaluated for construct validity. Participants in clinically stable conditions repeated J-FIHOA at a one- to two-week interval to assess test-retest reliability. To evaluate responsiveness, symptomatic patients who started new pharmacological treatments had a 1-month follow-up visit and completed the questionnaires twice. Effect size (ES) and standardized response mean (SRM) were calculated with pre- and post-treatment data sets. We assessed responsiveness, comparing ES and SRM of J-FIHOA with other questionnaires (construct approach).ResultsA total of 210 patients participated. J-FIHOA had unidimensional structure. Cronbach's alphas (0.914 among females and 0.929 among males) and item-total correlations (range, 0.508 to 0.881) revealed high internal consistency.

We use simultaneous small- and wide-angle x-ray scattering (SWAXS) and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS). The hydration number Z(hyd) of pNIPAm is determined by DRS. We observe a gradual decrease of Z(hyd) with increasing T below T-S - 6 K, where T-S is the spinodal temperature, and its subsequent steep decrease on approaching T-S. This eccentric two-mode dehydration behavior implies strong cooperative nature of hydration/dehydration of the pNIPAm chains. Furthermore, the observed dehydration is coupled to the critical fluctuations manifested by a power-law divergence of the correlation length xi. The emergence of a low-q interference peak provides evidence that high-density microglobules are formed even far below Ts, where a swollen coil state of polymer chains is generally considered to be predominant. The local number density of the microglobules is almost unchanged below Ts, but then exhibits a step-like increase just above Ts, where most pNIPAm chains are already collapsed. This observation suggests that in addition to the ordinary (macroscopic) density order parameter, the local number density of the microglobules should serve as an additional order parameter monitoring the phase transition of aqueous pNIPAm. The correlation length significantly decreases at higher polymer concentration because of the stronger interpenetration effect between different chains. At higher concentration, xi converges to similar values independent of molecular weight, which indicates an already congested state of the pNIPAm chains. Lowering averaged molecular weight leads to a stronger tendency of inter-chain aggregation and interface formation especially at high T. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Network analysis was used to study the properties of the B2B networks, and how their structures changed was characterized using the USD/JPY exchange rate. The network analysis revealed power-law properties of the B2B networks, and the core networks characterized by the largest degree centrality exhibited positive correlations with the USD/JPY exchange rate. By contrast, the peripheral networks characterized by the network path length exhibited the negative correlations with the exchange rate USD/JPY. Therefore, the changes that occurred in the B2B networks are explained as the complementarity of comparative advantages originating in the USD/JPY exchange rate. Moreover, the USD/JPY exchange rate affected the B2B networks through not only the complementarity of importing and exporting but also by changing the structures.","[Ogai, Yusaku; Matsumura, Yoshiyuki] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Hoshino, Yusuke] Musashino Univ, Fac Business Adm, 3-3-3 Ariake Koto, Tokyo 1358181, Japan","Ogai, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",yusaku66@gmail.com,,, [17K00302];  [24220012];  [23240100],"This study was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research 17K00302, 24220012, and 23240100.",,43,0,0,0,0,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2198-0802,,,FASH TEXT,Fash.

The Bridgman single crystals present almost the same magnetic properties as the previous aro-melted polycrystals, indicating a valence fluctuating state of the Eu ions. In the In-flux single crystals, the Eu ions are in the magnetic divalent state over the whole temperature range studied, and the system shows spin glass behavior below T-SG = 11.5 K. From the crystallographic analyses, it is found that both the Bridgman and In-flux single crystals crystallize in the ThCr2Si2-type crystal structure, but in the In-flux crystals, a sizeable amount of Cu is replaced by Si, resulting in an off-stoichiometric composition. This replacement may cause the formation of random bonds for the magnetic exchange interactions, which leads to competing magnetic interactions and gives rise to spin glass features in the In-flux single crystals.","[Takeuchi, Tetsuya] Osaka Univ, Low Temp Ctr, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Haga, Yoshinori] Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Adv Sci Res Ctr, Tokai, Ibaraki 3191195, Japan; [Taniguchi, Toshifumi] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Iha, Wataru; Ashitomi, Yousuke; Yara, Tomoyuki] Univ Ryukyus, Grad Sch Engn & Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030231, Japan; [Kida, Takanori; Tahara, Time; Hagiwara, Masayuki] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Ctr Adv High Magnet Field Sci, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Nakashima, Miho; Amako, Yasushi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Phys, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hedo, Masato; Nakama, Takao; Onuki, Yoshichika] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Sci, Nishihara, Okinawa 9030213, Japan","Takeuchi, T (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Low Temp Ctr, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18H04329, JP17K05547, JP16K05453]","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers JP18H04329, JP17K05547, and JP16K05453.

Here we report a novel cryodevice for bovine oocyte vitrification, silk fibroin (SF) sheet multilayer, of which spontaneous absorption property can eliminate pipette operation for removal of excess VS. Based on physical stability and scanning electron microscopic observation, the SF sheet prepared from 1.5% (wt/vol) fibroin solution was selected and layered around a polypropylene strip (0.1-mm thickness, 0.7-mm width, 10-mm depth). Ten denuded bovine mature oocytes were loaded onto the SF sheet multilayer with 2-3 mu L of the VS, and then cooled rapidly by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Nylon mesh (NM) device with square opening 37-mu m length of a side and commercially available Cryotop (R) (CT) device were used as controls, and the minimization of VS volume was performed by paper towel absorption and capillary aspiration, respectively. In SF, NM and CT groups, post-warming oocyte recovery rates were 99.5, 99.1 and 100%, and the morphological survival rates were 99.7, 94.5 and 99.0%, respectively. Subsequent IVF and 8-days IVC resulted in comparable blastocyst yields among the three groups (25.5, 25.0 and 26.1% in SF, NM and CT groups, respectively). These results suggest that SF sheet multilayer is a useful cryodevice for bovine matured oocytes in MVC vitrification because VS volume surrounding the oocytes can be easily minimized through its absorption property.

A three-tier pagoda, the Radha Krishna temple is studied. This Hindu temple was located in the historic centre of Patan, Nepal. The structure was composed of masonry walls of solid bricks and mud mortar with the timber frame structure placed in the walls. A large-scale intervention was carried out in 1992. Concrete ring beams were installed at the top of the ground tier and first-tier. Cross steel I-beams were located at the top of the first tier. The pagoda was completely collapsed after the Gorkha earthquake in 2015. The article discusses behavior and capacity of the pagoda under a seismic load. Two FE models are prepared, representing the state before and after the above-mentioned intervention. The adopted material properties are determined on the basis of the dynamic identification and laboratory material tests. Pushover and nonlinear dynamic analysis (NDA) are applied. An accelerogram generated from the Gorkha earthquake is considered for NDA. The applied seismic analyses examine closely the behavior and capacity of the pagoda before and after the intervention.

The quenching of fluorescence (turn OFF), with the addition of trace amounts of organic pollutant (4-NP) in NOCDs, has been attributed to the complete reduction of nitrogen-doped oxidized carbon dots (NOCDs) to reduced nitrogen-doped oxidized carbon dots (rNOCDs) and its formation was confirmed by infrared, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The chemical changes in oxygen-containing functional groups of NOCDs, in the presence of 4-NP, are elucidated and corresponding characterization through XPS reveals the changes in the peak intensities of C-C (284.5 eV) and O-C=O (288.6 eV), indicating a decrement in hydroxyl groups that hinder its complete reduction to NOCDs. The sensitivity of NOCDs towards 4-NP has been tested in spiked tap water in the concentration range 2 mu M to 2 mM with the minimum detection limit of 2 mu M (linear detection range from 2 to 100 mu M with regression coefficient R-2 =0.99). The proposed simple sensing platform can be used to reduce NOCDs and simultaneously sense low concentrations of 4-NP.

The rapid electrical pacing of cardiomyocytes has been used for efficiently promoting the maturation of cardiomyocytes, here we describe a simple device in modified culture plate on which hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can form three-dimensional self-organized tissue rings (SOTRs). Using calcium imaging, we show that within the ring, reentrant waves (ReWs) of action potential spontaneously originated and ran robustly at a frequency up to 4 Hz. After 2 weeks, SOTRs with ReWs show higher maturation including structural organization, increased cardiac-specific gene expression, enhanced Ca2+-handling properties, an increased oxygen-consumption rate, and enhanced contractile force. We subsequently use a mathematical model to interpret the origination, propagation, and long-term behavior of the ReWs within the SOTRs.

Morphologically, CDS partially resembles Ewing sarcoma (ES) and has been classified as ""ES-like sarcoma""; however, detailed clinicopathologic and molecular genetic analyses have indicated that CDS is a new independent disease. Many studies have provided light microscopic, immunohistochemical, and genetic information about CDS. However, ultrastructural findings associated with this sarcoma are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate the ultrastructure of CDS tumors and to compare their features with those of ES. We examined two cytogenetically confirmed CDS cases. We found that, compared to typical ES, CDS presented heterogeneity: in cell density, from tightly packed to loosely unconnected areas; in cell shape, from polygonal to pleomorphic with small processes; and in nuclear shape including round, oval, polygonal, elongated, invaginated, or wrinkled formations. However, abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm and rare cell adhesion apparatus between cells are major similarities between CDS and typical ES. Neuroendocrine granules, which are seen in rare ES cases, could not be identified in these two CDS cases. Although cytogenetic differences can validate a definite diagnosis, ultrastructural features could also provide important information about the differences between CDS and ES.","[Tamada, Hisashi] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kobayashi, Mikiko; Matsumoto, Yuki; Tateishi, Ayako; Ohya, Maki; Kanno, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sano, Kenji] Iida Municipal Hosp, Dept Pathol, Iida, Japan; [Uehara, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Lab Med, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kito, Munehisa] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Aoki, Kaoru] Shinshu Univ, Dept Appl Phys Therapy, Sch Hlth Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Kobayashi, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Pathol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",mikko@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,9,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0191-3123,1521-0758,,ULTRASTRUCT PATHOL,Ultrastruct.

The patients were divided into two groups: patients who received infliximab before plasma exchange (infliximab group) and patients who did not (non-infliximab group). The infliximab group showed a lesser median number of required total plasma exchange sessions (P = .002) and higher change and reduction rates in C-reactive protein before and after the first plasma exchange (both P = .027) than that of the non-infliximab group.

An expanding number of genetic syndromes have been shown to have unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called ""episignatures""). Peripheral blood episignatures can be used for diagnostic testing as well as for the interpretation of ambiguous genetic test results. We present here an approach to episignature mapping in 42 genetic syndromes, which has allowed the identification of 34 robust disease-specific episignatures. We examine emerging patterns of overlap, as well as similarities and hierarchical relationships across these episignatures, to highlight their key features as they are related to genetic heterogeneity, dosage effect, unaffected carrier status, and incomplete penetrance. We demonstrate the necessity of multiclass modeling for accurate genetic variant classification and show how disease classification using a single episignature at a time can sometimes lead to classification errors in closely related episignatures. We demonstrate the utility of this tool in resolving ambiguous clinical cases and identification of previously undiagnosed cases through mass screening of a large cohort of subjects with developmental delays and congenital anomalies. This study more than doubles the number of published syndromes with DNA methylation episignatures and, most significantly, opens new avenues for accurate diagnosis and clinical assessment in individuals affected by these disorders.","[Aref-Eshghi, Erfan;

This novel bone conduction hearing device is placed behind the ear and has an audio processor connected to the adapter to transmit sound through vibrations. Objective: To obtain preliminary results regarding the use of this device, we sought to apply it to patients with various types of hearing loss. Methods: Nine patients aged over 18 years and with hearing loss due to bilateral middle ear anomaly (n = 1), bilateral aural atresia (n = 3), unilateral aural atresia (n = 2), and single-sided deafness (n = 3) were recruited. Results: The functional gain provided by the adhesive bone conduction hearing device for the aided side was found to be sufficient. Although the results on speech perception in noise showed significant improvement for patients with conductive hearing loss, no improvement was found for patients with single-sided deafness. Subjective assessment showed that speech and spatial hearing-related issues were improved. Conclusion: The adhesive bone conduction hearing device was thought to provide a feasible option. Additionally, in patients considering the use of a surgically implanted hearing device, this device is a preferable option for preoperative assessment due to its non-invasiveness.","[Moteki, Hideaki; Kitoh, Ryosuke; Usami, Shin-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Moteki, Hideaki; Usami, Shin-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Hearing Implant Sci, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Usami, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",usami@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,13,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0001-6489,1651-2251,,ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL,Acta Oto-Laryngol.,2-Apr,2020,140,4,,,,,319,326,,10.1080/00016489.2019.1708969,,20-Mar,8,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,KY5ZK,WOS:000518972800001,32141794,"Other Gold, Bronze",,,2020/4/20

Aluminum (Al) composites with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been prepared by room-temperature electrodeposition in a relatively inexpensive and safe organic solvent, i.e. diglyme (G2). Successful dispersion of MWCNTs in an AICI(3)-G2 electrodeposition bath was achieved by surface modification i.e. acid treatment of MWCNTs, similar to the case of aqueous baths. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that MWCNTs filled and/or bridged the gap between Al particles, which can be attributed to the high Vickers hardness of 205 +/- 14 HV, exceeding 160 HV for Al-MWCNTs obtained by powder metallurgical methods.

The effect of the surfactant charge on the forces was determined by using an anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) and a cationic surfactant (dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, DTAB) of the same chain length. The surfactant concentration effect was determined by using concentrations up to the critical micelle concentration. In the case of SDS, a flow reduced the range and magnitude of the repulsive forces. The force range reduction was explained by a shrinking of the diffuse layers, due to the deformation of the diffuse layer by the flow. The force magnitude reduction was explained by (1) the increased electrostatic screening due to the thinner diffuse layers and (2) an increased adsorption of specific ions, such as Na+, to the silica surfaces. In the case of DTAB, a concentration (8.0 mM) that gave an attractive force in the absence of a flow gave a repulsive force in the presence of a flow. Comparison of AFM images of a silicon wafer in DTAB measured in the absence and presence of a liquid flow showed that the number of DTAB patches adsorbed to the silicon wafer increased with a liquid flow. The change in the forces with a flow was therefore explained by this change in the DTAB adsorption to the negatively charged surfaces. As a liquid flow can change the charge of a surface, it may be possible to control the aggregation/dispersion of charged particles via the flow rate, if the appropriate surfactant type and concentration are used.","[McNamee, Cathy E.; Kawakami, Hayato] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Mat, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","McNamee, CE (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Mat, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",mcnamee@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,, [19K05264],"The authors would like to thank and acknowledge Dr. Shinpei Yamamoto (Sankei Giken Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan) for fruitful discussions.

The appearance of the garments on four dress forms with different values of BL was compared using Scheffe's paired comparison (Nakaya's variation) of seven scales. In total, 20 Japanese subjects in their 20s evaluated the garments. Six evaluation items - wrinkle amount, fit, attractiveness, beauty, youthfulness and slimness - were used. The vertical ratios of the garments on each dress form, a (projected distance between the horizontal line of the shoulder points and the bustline) and b (projected distance between the bustline and waistline), were measured using 3D scanned data. The relationship between the ratios and the results of the sensory test was investigated. Findings It was found that changing the values of the BL influenced the appearance of the upper garments.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the predictability of clothing mobility via musculoskeletal simulation. Design/methodology/approach In order to carry out the musculoskeletal simulation considering the influence of clothing, simulation of the dressed state was attempted. This paper simulated the dressed state and measured the motion-related deformation of the clothing to estimate the force applied to the human body based on the material property of the clothing samples. The dressed state was simulated using an external force in the musculoskeletal model. Findings When the elbow flexion torque with an elbow supporter was calculated using the above-mentioned method of musculoskeletal simulation, it was confirmed that the lower the stretchability of the sample, the higher the elbow flexion torque. In addition, the sensory evaluation performed under the same condition as that in the simulation showed that the lower the joint torque during the motion, the higher the subjective mobility, and that the higher the joint torque, the lower the subjective mobility. Thus, it is suggested that musculoskeletal simulation of the dressed state can predict the clothing mobility. Originality/value Because it is difficult to estimate the force applied by the clothing to the human body, only a few studies have performed analysis on the effect of clothing by using musculoskeletal simulation. Conversely, although the force applied by the clothing to the human body needs to be estimated in advance by the measurement of the deformation, the utility of the simulation in clothing design seems to be high because the simulation can estimate clothing mobility and the effects of clothing on muscle activity.","[Horiba, Yosuke; Tokutake, Ayumu; Inui, S.] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano, Japan","Horiba, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano, Japan.",horiba@shinshu-u.ac.jp; 15fm219b@shinshu-u.ac.jp; inui@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,28,0,0,1,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0955-6222,1758-5953,,INT J CLOTH SCI TECH,Int.

The Kansei values were determined by a Japanese expert designer using standard fabric samples of a fabric type. The system uses two search methods to find the desired type of fabric: a category search method and a free word search method. After finding appropriate types of fabric, the user further narrows down the fabrics of the selected type to more suitable fabrics using the Kansei values. The validity of the Kansei values and the effectiveness of the system were verified by 11 professional designers from Japan and Sweden. Findings The Japanese and Swedish designers were satisfied with the fabrics retrieved for specific items and found that the system was effective. The Kansei values were similar among fashion designers and shown to be effective for fabric retrieval.

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyze the efficacy and safety of cabazitaxel based on treatment outcome data. Methods: A questionnaire form on the use of cabazitaxel was mailed to hospitals associated with the Shinshu University. Responses were received from 11 institutions regarding 55 cases. Results: Patients received a median of 4 courses of cabazitaxel treatment. Decreases in prostrate-specific antigen (PSA) were observed in 61.5% of cases with declines of 30%, 50%, and 90% in 36.5%, 23.0%, and 7.6% of cases, respectively. PSA progression-free survival was 5.0 months, and overall survival after the start of cabazitaxel was 13.0 months. Forty-five patients received postcabazitaxel treatment; 17 showed decreased PSA. Safety assessment indicated that white blood cell and neutrophil counts were significantly higher in the second than in the first course of treatment and Grade 3 to 4 leukopenia and neutropenia significantly decreased. Twenty-four subjects were aged >= 75 years; 79% of them had their doses reduced at the first administration. The mean dose was 20 mg/m(2). However, there was no significant difference in the PSA progression-free survival between the >= 75-year-old and <75-year-old groups. Patients in the >= 75-year-old group, particularly those whose doses were not reduced, experienced several Grade 3 to 4 adverse effects. Ten patients discontinued treatment owing to adverse effects and systemic worsening. Conclusions: To use cabazitaxel effectively, starting administration as early as possible before disease progression is important, and even if Grade 3 to 4 leukopenia and neutropenia are observed during the first course, it is important to carefully maintain the dose. Even when treating elderly patients, reducing the dose does not reduce therapeutic efficacy. However, because this cohort experienced several >= Grade 3 adverse effects, a great deal of caution is required. (C) 2020 Asian Pacific Prostate Society.

Increasing the drive frequency is an effective strategy for miniaturizing the transformer; however, this strategy increases the losses. In this article, we investigate strategies to reduce the losses arising from conductor-embedded planar transformers using magnetic flux-path control (MPC) technology. The ac resistance of a conductor-embedded planar transformer that uses the MPC technology is less than the ac resistance of a conventional conductor-embedded transformer. In this research, we prove that the Q-factor of our proposed transformer is superior to the Q-factor of the conventional transformers.","[Shimura, K.; Yamamoto, T.; Bu, Y.; Mizuno, T.] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Shimura, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",15t2050h@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Shimura, Kazuhiro/0000-0001-5286-4503",Research Grant of Support program for starting up innovation hub in Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center,This study was supported by the Research Grant of Support program for starting up innovation hub in Space Exploration Innovation Hub Center.,,10,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9464,1941-0069,,IEEE T MAGN,IEEE Trans.

We examined whether BMP-7 expression in thymic epithelial tumors is associated with their clinicopathological features. Methods: One hundred and thirty-two clinical specimens were analyzed in this study. The expression of BMP-7 was detected using immunohistochemistry and was scored as 0, 1, 2, or 3 according to its intensity and was then classified as negative (score 0 and 1) or positive (2 and 3). In addition, Ki-67 staining was performed in type B3 thymoma and thymic cancer. Results: The positive ratio of BMP-7 was 80% in thymic cancer and 70% in thymoma type B3. In contrast, the positive ratios of BMP-7 in type B2 (29.1%), B1 (3.7%), AB (26%), and A (31%) were relatively low. The mean Ki-67 labeling index of the BMP-7 positive group (10.1%+/- 5.9%) was significantly higher than that of the BMP-7 negative group (4.9%+/- 5.9%) in type B3 thymoma and thymic cancer (P=0.012). The BMP7 positive group showed significantly poorer overall survival (OS) than the BMP-7 negative group across all patients with thymic epithelial tumors and in all types of thymomas (P=0.006, P=0.018); however, no difference was observed in thymic cancers. Conclusions: This study showed that high expression of BMP-7 correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with thymic epithelial tumors, and the expression of BMP-7 was higher in type B3 thymomas and thymic cancers than in other types of thymomas. BMP-7 might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for thymic epithelial tumors.","[Miura, Kentaro; Hamanaka, Kazutoshi; Kanai, Yukiko; Matsuoka, Shunichiro; Takeda, Tetsu; Agatsuma, Hiroyuki; Hyogotani, Akira] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Div Gen Thorac Surg, Dept Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Uehara, Tsuyoshi; Momose, Masanobu] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Ito, Ken-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, Dept Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 390861, Japan","Ito, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, Dept Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 390861, Japan.",kenito@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,27,0,0,0,0,AME PUBL CO,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2072-1439,2077-6624,,J THORAC DIS,J.

A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between July 2014 and July 2018. A total of 504 consecutive elderly patients (age >= 75 years) with HF (mean age 85 years, 50% women) were enrolled. We used a multiple logistic regression analysis with stepwise variable selection to select predictive variables and to determine weighted point scores. After analysis, the following variables predicted short-term mortality and comprised the risk score: previous HF admission (3 points), New York Heart Association III or IV (2 points), body mass index < 17.7 kg/m(2) (4 points), serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL (9 points), and left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% (2 points). The c-statistic was 0.820. We compared mortality in low-risk (0-6 points, n = 188), intermediate-risk (7-13 points, n = 241), and high-risk (14-20 points, n = 75) groups. A total of 43 (8.5%) patients died within 6 months after discharge. Mortality was significantly higher in groups with higher scores (low-risk group, 0.5%; intermediate-risk group, 9.1%; high-risk group, 26.7%; P < 0.001). We developed a predictive model for 6-month mortality in elderly patients with HF. This risk score could be useful when discussing advanced HF therapies, palliative care, or hospice referral with patients.","[Suzuki, Sho; Kanzaki, Yusuke; Maruyama, Takuya; Hashizume, Naoto; Kozuka, Ayako; Yahikozawa, Kumiko] Shinonoi Gen Hosp, Minaminagano Med Ctr, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Nagano, Japan; [Motoki, Hirohiko; Kuwahara, Koichiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Sch Med, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Motoki, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Cardiovasc Med, Sch Med, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",hmotoki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,INT HEART JOURNAL ASSOC,TOKYO,"UNIV TOKYO, GRADUATE SCHOOL MEDICINE, DEPT CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE, HONGO 7-3-1, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-8655, JAPAN",1349-2365,1349-3299,,INT HEART J,Int.

Methods: Non-duplicated MRSA clinical isolates recovered between July 2016 and January 2018 were analysed. The MRSA isolates were typed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based open reading frame (ORF) typing (POT) scores, SCCmec types, multilocus sequence typing, and virulence gene profiles. Phylogenetic comparison of those isolates with previously described human isolates was performed. Results: Among 56 MRSA isolates (33 cats, 20 dogs and three rabbits), 26 isolates with a POT1 score of 93, SCCmec type II mostlybelonged to CC5, including ST5. Twenty-six isolates with a POT1 score of 106, SCCmec type IV showed diversity of STs: 15 isolates belonged to CC8, mainly including ST8, and 11 isolates belonged to CC1, including ST1 and newly identified STs 4768, 4775, and 4779. Two cat isolates were ST8-SCCmec type IV possessing pvl/ACME-arcA, presumed to be the hypervirulent community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) clone USA300. Notably, all three rabbit isolates belonged to ST4768. The POT1 score 106 CA-MRSA isolates from animals and humans were divided into two large clusters of CC1 and CC8, where host species-specific sub-clusters were not identified within each cluster. A large cluster of POT1 score 93 healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) isolates from animals and humans consisted of sub-clusters formed exclusively by the vast majority of human isolates and those formed by animal and human isolates. Conclusion: Companion animals could be potential reservoirs and vehicles for the transmission of CA-MRSA to humans, and could transmit companion animal-adaptive HA-MRSA lineages to humans as their second reservoirs.

Ruby crystals have been grown using the molybdenum trioxide (MoO3) flux evaporation method. Herein, we report the effect of holding temperature on the growth of ruby crystal films via MoO3 flux evaporation. All temperature effects were investigated considering the epitaxial growth of ruby crystal film on sapphire crystal substrates. First, the solubility curve of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) in MoO3 flux was examined in the temperature range 1050-1200 degrees C. The difference in solubilities between 1050 and 1200 degrees C was similar to 0.4 mol %. However, higher temperatures increased the crystal film growth rate due to increased flux evaporation rate. The difference in the crystal growth rate produced a difference in the surface pattern of the ruby crystal films. The surface of the ruby crystal films exhibited ellipsoidal patterns with a wide step interval at 1100 degrees C and circular patterns with a narrow step interval at 1200 degrees C. Finally, the material balance between the dissolved mass supplied by the dissolution of the substrates and the mass of grown ruby crystals was investigated. All dissolved solutes were found to be crystallized in ruby crystals, either in film or in particle form.","[Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn & Res Initiat Supra Mat, Dept Mat Chem, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Ayuzawa, Shunsuke; Oishi, Shuji; Teshima, Katsuya] Nagano Prefecture Nanshin Inst Technol, Nagano 3994511, Japan; [Ayuzawa, Shunsuke] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Suzuki, Sayaka; Hidaka, Miki; Oishi, Shuji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mat Chem, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn & Res Initiat Supra Mat, Dept Mat Chem, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Teshima, K (reprint author), Nagano Prefecture Nanshin Inst Technol, Nagano 3994511, Japan.",teshima@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JSPS [18K05272, 17K14809]; Society for the Promotion of Nanshin-Koka-Tandai","This work was partially supported by A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology of the Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (No. 18K05272), JSPS Grants-i-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (No. 17K14809), and a grant from the Society for the Promotion of Nanshin-Koka-Tandai.",,23,0,0,0,0,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1528-7483,1528-7505,,CRYST GROWTH DES,Cryst.

Therefore, it is important to understand PPC performance against pathogen penetration. Currently, standard methods to evaluate and classify the penetration resistance of PPC fabrics with pressure using synthetic blood or phi-X174 phage have been established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). However, the penetration of viral liquid drops (VLDrop) on the PPC without pressure is also a major exposure route and more realistic, necessitating further studies. Here, we evaluated the penetration resistance against VLDrop without pressure using phi-X174 phage on woven and nonwoven fabrics of commercially available PPC classified by the ISO, and analyzed in detail the penetration behaviors of VLDrop by quantifying the phage amounts in leakthrough and migration into test fabrics. Our results showed that some nonwoven test fabrics had nearly the same penetration resistance against VLDrop, even if the ISO resistance class differed. Furthermore, the results revealed that the amount of leakage through the fabrics was correlated with the migration amount into the fabric, which was related to fluid-repellency of fabrics, suggesting the effectiveness for penetration resistance. Our study may facilitate more appropriate selection for PPC against pathogen penetration.","[Shimasaki, Noriko; Shinohara, Katsuaki] Natl Inst Infect Dis, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 2080011, Japan; [Okaue, Akira] Kitasato Res Ctr Environm Sci, Minami Ku, 1-15-1 Kitasato, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2520329, Japan; [Morimoto, Michiko] Univ Hyogo, 13-71 Kitaoji Cho, Akashi, Hyogo 6738588, Japan; [Uchida, Yukiko] Takasaki Univ Hlth & Welf, 37-1 Nakaorui Machi, Takasaki, Gumma 3700033, Japan; [Koshiba, Tomoko; Tsunoda, Kaoru] Bunka Gakuen Univ, Shibuya Ku, 3-22-1 Yoyogi, Tokyo 1518523, Japan; [Arakawa, Soichi] Sanda City Hosp, 3-1-1 Keyakidai, Sanda, Hyogo 6691321, Japan; [Morimoto, Michiko] Okayama Prefectural Univ, 111 Kuboki, Soja, Okayama 7191197, Japan; [Shinohara, Katsuaki] Shinshu Univ, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Shimasaki, N (reprint author), Natl Inst Infect Dis, 4-7-1 Gakuen, Musashimurayama, Tokyo 2080011, Japan.",shima@nih.go.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19209023, 15H01789, 15H02581]; AMED [JP19fk0108070]","We thank Dr. H.

We compared the electrical properties of hybrid iPLEDs with solution-processed hybrid EILs deposited at low temperature (<120 degrees C) consisting of ZnO/polyethyleneimine (PEI), PEI/tantalum oxide nanosheet (TaO-NS), and PEI/TaO-NS/TmPyPB multilayers. The combination of PEI dipole and ultrathin TaO-NS (similar to 1 nm) layers improved the EL efficiency and operating voltages owing to the energy level shift of similar to 1 eV and the effective hole blocking at the ITO/TaO-NS/LEP interface. However, a considerable barrier height of >0.5 eV still existed at the TaO-NS/PFO interface. The insertion of electron-transporting small molecules between the TaO-NS and PFO layer effectively reduced the electron injection barrier height and electron transport properties of the multilayered iPLEDs resulting in improved EQE and operating voltage for the blue-light iPLEDs.

We therefore investigated elbow pathology and neurological severity in Japanese patients with UNE. Methods: The medical records of 457 Japanese UNE patients who were surgically treated among 6 hospitals were retrospectively examined. Eligible patients had UNE diagnosed by physical findings and nerve conduction studies according to the criteria of the American Association of Electrodiagnostic Medicine. The elbows were analyzed with regard to age, gender, occupation, pathology at the elbow, and severity of nerve palsy. Results: A total of 398 patients with 413 UNE elbows of a mean age of 63 years (range: 15-87) met the inclusion criteria. UNE elbows were predominantly in male patients (69.0%). Overall, 310 elbows (75.1%) had 1 or more elbow lesions: 238 elbows (76.8%) had a single lesion and 72 elbows (23.3%) had 2 or more lesions. The most common lesion was primary elbow osteoarthritis (EOA) occurring in 54.5% of elbows, followed next by medial elbow ganglion in 8.5% and cubitus valgus in 6.5%. Most elbows with medial elbow ganglion or cubitus valgus were associated with EOA. Entrapment sites were at the cubital tunnel in 84.5%-91.3% of UNE elbows, regardless of an association with elbow lesion. The incidence of McGowan grade III lesion was 50.8% in elbows with primary EOA, which was higher than the 35.0% in elbows with no lesion. Conclusions: This study revealed that UNE had various isolated or combined elbow lesions. In Japanese UNE, primary or secondary EOA was found in 62.2% of cases and severe motor weakness was noted in 47.2%. The incidences of EOA and severe ulnar nerve palsy in the Japanese UNE are higher than those in Caucasians. (C) 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Automatic berthing is not an easy task because of some complexities that are included in the problem, such as the nonlinearity of the low-speed maneuvering model, danger of collision with berth, etc. In this research, as a first step, the authors solved the off-line automatic berthing problem. Here, the optimal control problem was modeled as minimum-time problem, and the collision risk with the berth was taken into account. The authors attempted to apply the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES), which is considered state-of-the-art in evolutionary computation approaches for optimization of real-valued variables. In the problem dealt with here, a propeller and a rudder were used only as control inputs; so, the degree of difficulty was significantly high. Nevertheless, optimal control method based on the CMA-ES successfully gave us the offline results for typical situations considered. It is noteworthy that preparation of a feasible initial control input was not required in the calculation process, which made the proposed procedure robust. The calculation method proposed here is offline, but the results could be applied as an initial guess in an online (real-time) control problem.","[Maki, Atsuo; Nishikawa, Hiroyuki; Umeda, Naoya] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650971, Japan; [Sakamoto, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Akimoto, Youhei] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Engn Informat & Syst, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058573, Japan","Maki, A (reprint author), Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Engn, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, 2-1 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650971, Japan.",maki@naoe.eng.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,Fundamental Research Developing Association for Shipbuilding and Offshore (REDAS) in Japan [FY2018],The authors are grateful to Mr. Koichi Shouji and Dr. Satoshi Masuda in JMU (Japan Marine United Corporation) for their technical advices and discussions.

Methods From 2002 to 2017, 148 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for femoral metastasis were included in this study. Prognostic risk assessments were performed according to the Katagiri and revised Katagiri scoring system. In general, the low-risk group underwent resection and reconstruction with endoprosthetic replacement (EPR), while the high-risk group underwent internal fixation (IF) and radiation therapy. For the intermediate-risk group, the operative choice depended on the patient's condition, degree of bone destruction, and radio-sensitivity. Overall survival, local failure, walking ability, and systemic complications were evaluated. Results A total of 83 patients underwent EPR (low-risk, 23%; intermediate-risk, 60%; high-risk, 17%) and 65 patients underwent IF (low-risk, 0%; intermediate-risk, 32%; high-risk, 68%). The one-year survival rate was 71% for EPR and 15% for IF (p < 0.001). The one-year local failure-free survival was 93% for EPR and 67% for IF, and the two-year and five-year local failure-free survival for EPR were both 88% (p = 0.016). Although the ambulatory rate was 99% for EPR and 60% for IF, the median time to ambulation was shorter in the IF (EPR, 28 days, interquartile range (IQR) 25 to 35; IF, 23 days, IQR 18 to 28; p < 0.001) The cause of non ambulation was mainly due to progression of cancer (89%). The rate of systemic complications was comparable between the two groups (EPR, 18%; IF, 22%; p = 0.598). Conclusion Selective use of EPR where survival is expected to be good offers correspondingly good long-term results. IF is less invasive with shorter treatment period, which is beneficial for patients with short-term expected survival. Prognosis is an important indicator in selecting operative procedures for femoral metastasis.","[Tanaka, A.] Shizuoka Canc Ctr Hosp, Shizuoka, Japan; Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Nagano, Japan","Tanaka, A (reprint author), Shizuoka Canc Ctr Hosp, Shizuoka, Japan.",tanaatsu@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,BRITISH EDITORIAL SOC BONE JOINT SURGERY,LONDON,"22 BUCKINGHAM STREET, LONDON WC2N 6ET, ENGLAND",2049-4394,,,BONE JOINT J,Bone Joint J.,MAR,2020,102B,3,,,,,285,292,,10.1302/0301-620X.102B3.BJJ-2019-0976.R1,,,8,Orthopedics; Surgery,Orthopedics; Surgery,KT1MX,WOS:000518776800004,32114815,,,,2020/4/20

Objectives: To (1) compare skeletal muscle mass index (SMI) and the composition of paraspinal muscles between patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and adult spinal deformity (ASD) who underwent spinal surgery, (2) determine whether paraspinal muscles influence low back pain in ASD, and (3) ascertain which radiographic spinal parameters of ASD are predominantly influenced by paraspinal muscles. Summary of Background Data: Relative muscle cross-sectional area (rmCSA; total CSA minus intramuscular fat CSA) determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful when evaluating not only muscle volume but also muscle quality. Currently, no study has examined paraspinal muscles using rmCSAs to determine which radiographic spinopelvic parameters identified in patients with severe spinal deformities make them candidates for thoracolumbar corrective surgery. Materials and Methods: Paraspinal muscle rmCSAs were calculated using preoperative T2-weighted MRIs at the L3/4 axial level. Whole-body bone mineral density and lean, soft tissue mass were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. SMI was calculated as appendicular (upper and lower limbs) lean, soft tissue mass (kg/m(2)). Correlations between low back pain according to the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index, spinopelvic parameters, and rmCSA were evaluated for 110 consecutive patients with ASD and 50 consecutive patients with LSS who underwent spinal surgery. Results: There was no significant difference in the total SMI and morbidity rate of sarcopenia between patients with ASD and LSS. A significant negative correlation between Oswestry Disability Index and the rmCSA of the multifidus muscles and the rmCSA of the erector muscles were observed. There was a significant positive correlation between pelvic tilt/sacral slope and multifidus/erector muscles. Conclusions: Paraspinal muscles evaluated with MRI were more significantly associated with the pathology of ASD compared with appendicular skeletal muscle evaluations with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. The present study indicates that multifidus and erector muscles significantly influenced the maintenance of the pelvic alignment.","[Katsu, Marina; Ohba, Tetsuro; Ebata, Shigeto; Koyama, Kensuke; Haro, Hirotaka] Univ Yamanashi, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Yamanashi, Japan; [Oba, Hiroki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Ohba, T (reprint author), Univ Yamanashi, Dept Orthopaed, Chuo Ku, 1110 Shimokato, Yamanashi 4093898, Japan.",tooba@yamanashi.ac.jp,,,,,,22,0,0,1,2,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",2380-0186,,,CLIN SPINE SURG,Clin.

The player is offered not only a buy and a rent options but also other options that charge both initial and per-time fees. The competitive ratio of the classical skirental problem is known to be 2. In contrast, the best known so far on the competitive ratio of the multislope ski-rental problem is an upper bound of 4 and a lower bound of 3.62. In this paper we consider a parametric version of the multislope ski-rental problem, regarding the number of options as a parameter. We prove an upper bound for the parametric problem which is strictly less than 4. Moreover, we give a simple recurrence relation that yields an equation having a lower bound value as its root.","[Fujiwara, Hiroshi; Shibusawa, Kei; Yamamoto, Kouki; Yamamoto, Hiroaki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Shibusawa, Kei] JRC Engn Co Ltd, Perris, CA USA; [Yamamoto, Kouki] AISIN ComCruise Co Ltd, Kariya, Aichi, Japan","Fujiwara, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",fujiwara@cs.shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K00033, 17K00013, 17K00183]","This work was supported by KAKENHI (16K00033, 17K00013, and 17K00183).",,18,0,0,0,0,IEICE-INST ELECTRONICS INFORMATION COMMUNICATIONS ENG,TOKYO,"KIKAI-SHINKO-KAIKAN BLDG, 3-5-8, SHIBA-KOEN, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-0011, JAPAN",1745-1361,,,IEICE T INF SYST,IEICE Trans.

Although gliding tissue reconstruction is effective in preventing peritendinous adhesion formation and a dorsal digital adipofascial flap is a reliable method to prevent scar adhesion between tendon and bone after extensor tendon repair, no comparative clinical reports exist. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of a gliding tissue reconstruction method by comparing postoperative range of motion between patients who underwent gliding tissue reconstruction and those who did not. Methods Medical records of patients with complex extensor tendon injury who underwent extensor repair between April 2005 and March 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Ten patients underwent extensor repair with gliding tissue reconstruction using a dorsal digital adipofascial flap and 13 underwent only extensor repair. A triangular flap was separated after zig-zag incision to expose the injured extensor tendon into dermal and adipofascial flaps. The adipofascial flap, based on a dorsal branch of the digital artery, was placed on the injured bone as the tendon gliding surface. The same extensor tendon suture method and rehabilitation protocol were used in both groups. All patients were followed up for 6 to 12 months. Results The mean +/- SD % total active movements were 84.1% +/- 12.4% and 57.6% +/- 13.0% in the groups with and without gliding tissue reconstruction, respectively. Significant differences were found between the 2 groups (P < 0.05). Conclusions Patients with gliding tissue reconstruction had better functional recovery. This reconstruction is recommended to restore the extensor function in cases of complex extensor injury involving finger tendons and bones.","[Hosomi, Kento; Iwasawa, Motonao; Mishima, Yoshito] Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 5-22-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3800928, Japan; [Kawamura, Tatsuya] Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Nagano, Japan; [Nagai, Fumio] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Nagano, Japan","Hosomi, K (reprint author), Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, 5-22-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3800928, Japan.",hosomi@shinshu-prs.jp,,,,,,14,0,0,1,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0148-7043,1536-3708,,ANN PLAS SURG,Ann.

In this paper, we present the results of a blind search for point sources of ultra-high-energy (UHE) photons in the Northern sky using the TA SD data. The photon-induced extensive air showers are separated from the hadron-induced extensive air shower background by means of a multivariate classifier based upon 16 parameters that characterize the air shower events. No significant evidence for the photon point sources is found. The upper limits are set on the flux of photons from each particular direction in the sky within the TA field of view, according to the experiment's angular resolution for photons. The average 95 per cent confidence level upper-limits for the point-source flux of photons with energies greater than 10(18), 10(18.5), 10(19), 10(19.5) and 10(29) eV are 0.094, 0.029, 0.010, 0.0073 and 0.0058 km(-2) yr(-1), respectively. For energies higher than 10(18.5) eV, the photon point-source limits are set for the first time. Numerical results for each given direction in each energy range are provided as a supplement to this paper.","[Abbasi, R. U.; Abu-Zayyad, T.; Allen, M.; Barcikowski, E.; Belz, J. W.; Bergman, D.

VMs in the head and neck typically have lower pain rates due to complications than VMs in the limbs and trunk. We evaluated the heuristics on VM pain by statistically analyzing data of patients with VM from a multicenter database in Japan. Methods: We collected data on age, sex, pain, lesion site, lesion depth, and lesion size for 2199 clinical cases with common VMs. We created categories for lesion depth and size and excluded multiple lesion cases that overlapped in these categories. Next, we constructed cross-tabulation tables to analyze the factors that contributed to pain. Finally, we evaluated the risk of pain in patients with VM by performing binomial logistic regression analysis based on age, sex, lesion site, lesion depth, and lesion size. Results: For patients with limb and trunk VMs, the most frequent site of pain was the muscle, tendon, and bone, with an incidence of 79%, followed by the skin and subcutis, with an incidence of 43%. For patients with head and neck VMs, the most frequent site of pain was the muscle, tendon, and bone, with an incidence of 28%, followed by the skin and subcutis, with an incidence of 11% (P<.01). For pain incidence by lesion size, pain most frequently occurred in lesions >10 cm (67%), followed by lesions between 5 cm and 10 cm (56%) and lesions <5 cm (29%). Conclusions: Our study indicated a clear order of factors that contributed to pain: lesion site > lesion depth > lesion size. Age was also an important factor. Infants and children had low pain complication frequencies with limb and trunk VMs. As the patients aged, the pain frequency became higher, reaching 50% at almost 7 years of age.","[Rikihisa, Naoaki] Chiba Rosai Hosp, Dept Plast Surg, 2-16 Tatsumidai Higashi, Ichihara, Chiba 2900003, Japan; [Akita, Sadanori] Fukuoka Univ, Sch Med, Dept Plast Surg Wound Repair & Regenerat, Fukuoka, Japan; [Osuga, Keigo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Mimura, Hidefumi] St Marianna Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; [Yuzuriha, Shunsuke] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Sasaki, Satoru] Tonan Hosp, KKR Sapporo Med Ctr, Ctr Vasc Anomalies, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Rikihisa, N (reprint author), Chiba Rosai Hosp, Dept Plast Surg, 2-16 Tatsumidai Higashi, Ichihara, Chiba 2900003, Japan.",rikihisa@faculty.chiba-u.jp,,,"Survey on Intractable hemangioma, vascular malformation, lymphangioma, lymphangiomatosis and related diseases, Health and Labor Sciences Research Grants intractable diseases [H29-Nanchi-Ippan-014]","This study was supported by a Survey on Intractable hemangioma, vascular malformation, lymphangioma, lymphangiomatosis and related diseases (H29-Nanchi-Ippan-014), Health and Labor Sciences Research Grants intractable diseases such as policy research projects (intractable disease policy research project).",,10,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2213-333X,,,J VASC SURG-VENOUS L,J.

Stainless steel filaments are used as the core, and high-strength ultraviolet resistant polyester (PET) filaments are used as the sheath materials to manufacture functional wrapped yarns. The wrapped yarns are made into woven fabric via weaving process. The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness and ultraviolet resistance of woven fabrics are evaluated in order to examine the influence of the number of laminated layer and laminated angles. The test results show that the two-layered woven fabrics that are laminated at 90 degrees have the optimal ultraviolet resistance and electromagnetic shielding effectiveness. Stainless steel/ultraviolet resistance PET woven fabrics are also light weight and can be custom-made into planar protective textile composites based on users' commands and also can be used in the outdoor domains.","[Lin, Ting An; Lin, Mei-Chen] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Lin, Ting Ru; Sim, Keng Siang] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Fiber & Composite Mat, Lab Fiber Applicat & Mfg, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Jia-Horng; Lou, Ching-Wen] Minjiang Univ, Fujian Key Lab Novel Funct Text Fibers & Mat, Fuzhou, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jia-Horng; Lou, Ching-Wen] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Sch Text, Innovat Platform Intelligent & Energy Saving Text, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jia-Horng; Lou, Ching-Wen] Qingdao Univ, Coll Text & Clothing, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jia-Horng] China Med Univ, Sch Chinese Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Jia-Horng] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Fiber & Composite Mat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Jia-Horng] Asia Univ, Dept Fash Design, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lin, Jia-Horng] Tianjin Polytech Univ, Key Lab Adv Text Composite Mat, Tianjin & Minist Educ, Tianjin, Peoples R China; [Lin, Jia-Horng; Lou, Ching-Wen] Asia Univ, Dept Bioinformat & Med Engn, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lou, Ching-Wen] China Med Univ, China Med Univ Hosp, Dept Med Res, Taichung, Taiwan","Lou, CW (reprint author), Cent Taiwan Univ Sci & Technol, 666 Buzih Rd, Taichung 40601, Taiwan.",cwlou@asia.edu.tw,,"Lou, Ching-Wen/0000-0002-5448-6347","Ministry of Science and Technology of TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [MOST 106-2622-E-468-005-CC3, MOST 107-2622-E-035-011-CC3, MOST 107-2632-E-035 -001 -]","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors would especially like to thank the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan, for financially supporting this research under Contract MOST 106-2622-E-468-005-CC3, MOST 107-2622-E-035-011-CC3 and MOST 107-2632-E-035 -001 -.",,32,0,0,0,0,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1528-0837,1530-8057,,J IND TEXT,J.

We here evaluated PCDH17 mRNA expression in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and ALL. PCDH17 mRNA expression levels in children with ALL/AML were lower than those in healthy counterparts. We next elucidated the mechanism underlying down-regulation of PCDH17 mRNA, using myeloid and lymphoid leukemic cell lines. Treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) resulted in restoration of PCDH17 mRNA expression and growth inhibition in K562, HL60, REH, and RCH-ACV cell lines. Upregulation of PCDH17 mRNA expression resulted from histone H3 acetylation. Knockdown of the PCDH17 gene, caused by transduction of PCDH17-targeted shRNA, significantly enhanced the proliferation of KU812 cells. Meanwhile, overexpression of PCDH17 via retroviral-particle transfection substantially inhibited the growth of Kasumi1 cells. The fold-increase in PCDH17 mRNA expression mediated by 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, was fundamentally lower than that produced by TSA. In conclusion, our results suggest that PCDH17 gene functions as a common tumor suppressor gene in leukemic cells, and that histone deacetylase inhibitors re-express PCDH17 mRNA to a greater extent than demethylation reagents.","[Thanh Nha Uyen, Le] Hue Univ Med & Pharm, Dept Med Genet, Hue, Vietnam; [Amano, Yuji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Microbiol & Immunol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Thanh Nha Uyen, Le; Al-Kzayer, Lika'a Fasih Y.; Nakazawa, Yozo; Koike, Kenichi; Sakashita, Kazuo] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kubota, Noriko; Kobayashi, Jun] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Azumino, Japan; [Koike, Kenichi] Shinonoi Gen Hosp, Minami Nagano Ctr, Nagano, Japan; [Sakashita, Kazuo] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, 3100 Toyoshina, Nagano, Japan","Sakashita, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.; Sakashita, K (reprint author), Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, 3100 Toyoshina, Nagano, Japan.",sakasita@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17K10105]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H04874]",,,36,0,0,2,2,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0925-5710,1865-3774,,INT J HEMATOL,Int.

This EM fungus develops shiros, which are mycelial aggregations that develop in association with the roots of EM coniferous trees and soil particles in well-drained and nutrient-poor forest soil. The fruiting bodies occur on the periphery of the outward-growing shiro. In spite of vast research, the cultivation of matsutake has been mostly unsuccessful. Commercial demand is therefore met by harvesting the fruiting bodies that naturally occur in forests of EM coniferous trees, mainly Pinus densiflora. Recent inoculation studies have produced mycorrhiza and shiro structures, and the host range of Tr. matsutake and associated species has been clarified. It has also become possible to identify strains of Tr. matsutake by DNA sequencing, which has also been useful to determine the origins of matsutake species in Asia and to elucidate the genetic structure of shiro. In this review, basic research and the outcomes of various trial of matsutake cultivation are discussed. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Questions and arguments related to the Omega(int) nature and its dependence with the nanotube's growth processes have also been addressed. Later, studies involving bundled (innermost tubes) and isolated (innermost and middle tubes) of triple-walled nanotubes (TWNTs) for diameters between 0.5 and 1.7 nm found no omega(RBM) fine structuring or mixing but suggested that the Omega(int) depends on the tube's metallicity. Here, Raman Spectroscopy is combined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to show that for bundled DWNTs and TWNTs measured in a broad diameter range (0:5 <= dt <= 2:8 nm) three effects seem to be fundamental to explain the omega(RBM) behavior of their constituent tubes: interactions with the external environment, metallicity-independent Omega(int) and curvature effects due to sigma-pi bonds re-hybridization. Our results display no evidence of omega(RBM) mixing but show that Omega(int) has no apparent dependence with the growth process and that Omega(int) has the same nature of the tube interactions with the environment.

Several studies have shown that patients with neurological disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease, develop taste disturbance. Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy (FOSMN) is a rare disease characterized by sensory disturbance and weakness spreading from the face to the limbs caudally. We describe a patient with FOSMN who showed taste disorder as the sole initial symptom. Case presentation A 49-year-old man who smoked cigarettes developed taste disturbance. Despite using zinc supplements, an herbal medication, and an ointment, his taste disorder worsened. 4 years later, a tingling feeling emerged at the tip of his tongue and gradually spread to his entire lips. At 55 years of age, he showed difficulty in swallowing, followed by facial paresthesia, muscle atrophy, and weakness in the face and upper limbs without apparent upper motor neuron sign. Cessation of smoking did not improve his taste disturbance, and he was unable to discriminate different tastes on the entire tongue. In an electrogustometric study, electrical stimulation did not induce any type of taste sensation. Blink reflex showed delayed or diminished R2 responses. Needle electromyography revealed severe chronic neurogenic changes in the tongue and masseter muscles. Mild chronic neurogenic changes were also observed in the limbs. In the thoracic paraspinal muscles, active neurogenic changes were detected. Findings of hematological and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and magnetic resonance images of the brain and spinal cord were unremarkable. One cycle of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy did not improve his symptoms. We diagnosed him as having FOSMN with the sole initial symptom of taste disorder. Nine years after the onset of taste disorder, he developed impaired sensation of touch in the right upper limb and required tube feeding and ventilator support. Conclusion Taste disorder can be the initial manifestation of FOSMN and might involve the solitary nucleus.","[Ohashi, Nobuhiko; Nonami, Jin; Kodaira, Minori; Sekijima, Yoshiki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Neurol & Rheumatol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yoshida, Kunihiro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Brain Dis Res, Div Neurogenet, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sekijima, Yoshiki] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Kodaira, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Neurol & Rheumatol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",mkodaira@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2377,,BMC NEUROL,BMC Neurol.,29-Feb,2020,20,1,,,,,,,71,10.1186/s12883-020-01639-x,,,5,Clinical Neurology,Neurosciences & Neurology,KS9TE,WOS:000518652100001,32113480,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

We extracted mRNA from a CCC cell line (RMG-1), established a cDNA library using a retroviral vector, transfected that library into mouse NIH3T3 cells and sequenced the resultant foci. The tissue-type specific expression of isolated genes and their transforming activities were evaluated. Seven genes were isolated. Of these genes, the mRNA expression of SEC61B and DVL1 is significantly stronger in CCC than in other histological types (p < .05). Immunohistochemical staining reveals the stronger expression of SEC61B and C1ORF38 than normal ovarian tissues (p < .05). Focus formation is confirmed by the transfection of SEC61B, C1ORF38, and DVL1 into NIH3T3 cells. The present study identified novel genes including SEC61B, C1ORF38, and DVL1, involved in the pathogenesis of CCC. These genes may be additional therapeutic targets for CCC.Impact statement What is already known on this subject? Several important genetic abnormalities, including ARID1A and PIK3CA mutations, have been reported in ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC). What the results of this study add?

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of PNI changes in patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).MethodsWe reviewed patients with breast cancer who underwent NAC and a subsequent surgery for breast cancer between 2005 and 2016. PNI before and after NAC were calculated using the following formula: 10xserum albumin (g/dl)+0.005xtotal lymphocyte count/mm(3). The relationship between PNI and prognosis was retrospectively analyzed.ResultsIn total, 191 patients were evaluated. There was no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between the pre-NAC PNI high group and the pre-NAC PNI low group (cutoff: 53.1). However, PNI decreased in 181 patients (94.7%) after NAC and the mean PNI also significantly decreased after NAC from 52.63.8 pre-NAC to 46.5 +/- 4.4 post-NAC (p<0.01). The mean <Delta>PNI, which was calculated as pre-NAC PNI minus post-NAC PNI, was 5.4. The high Delta PNI group showed significantly poorer DFS than the low Delta PNI group (cut off: 5.26) (p=0.015). Moreover, high Delta PNI was an independent risk factor of DFS on multivariate analysis (p=0.042).Conclusions p id=Par High decrease of PNI during NAC predicts poor prognosis. Thus, maintaining the nutritional status during NAC may result in better treatment outcomes in patients with breast cancer.","[Oba, Takaaki; Maeno, Kazuma; Takekoshi, Daiya; Ono, Mayu; Ito, Tokiko; Kanai, Toshiharu; Ito, Ken-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Maeno, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",kmaeno@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,46,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2407,,BMC CANCER,BMC Cancer,27-Feb,2020,20,1,,,,,,,,10.1186/s12885-020-6647-4,,,10,Oncology,Oncology,KV6IY,WOS:000520586300004,32106833,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

To date, the factors predictive of preserving residual hearing remain a controversial topic. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive factors, including the etiology of hearing loss (HL) as a patient-related factor, influencing residual HP after CI. Methods: Forty-four patients (50 ears, 41 families) with residual acoustic hearing who underwent CI were included. Auditory thresholds before and at 6 months after initial activation were measured. Genetic testing was performed to identify the responsible genes for HL. Results: We identified the cause of HL in 21 families (51.2%). HP was marginally correlated with age at implantation, while it was independent of pre-operative low-frequency hearing thresholds, cochlear duct length, and electrode length. We found that patients who had pathogenic variants in the CDH23, MYO7A, or MYO15A gene showed statistically better HP scores compared with patients with HL due to other causes (p = .002). Conclusions: Identification of the etiology of HL using genetic testing is likely to facilitate the prediction of HP after implant surgery.","[Yoshimura, Hidekane; Moteki, Hideaki; Nishio, Shin-ya; Miyajima, Hiroki; Miyagawa, Maiko; Usami, Shin-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Moteki, Hideaki; Nishio, Shin-ya; Miyagawa, Maiko; Usami, Shin-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Hearing Implant Sci, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Usami, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",usami@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H29-Nanchitou(Nan)-Ippan-031]; Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [16kk0205010h001, 18ek0109363h0001]; Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [15H02565]","This research was funded by a Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant for Research on Rare and Intractable Diseases and Comprehensive Research on Disability Health and Welfare from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan (S.U.

The photoreaction is a formal [3+3] cycloaddition, where a nitrone and a diaminomethane act as the 1,3-dipole and the 1,3-synthon, respectively. The reaction is significantly accelerated with benzophenone as a photosensitizer.

To date, 42 patients with aEDS have been published. We report 12 patients with aEDS from 10 families with 6 unpublished individuals and follow-up data on 6 adult patients. The clinical features are largely comparable with patients reported in the literature. Most (n = 10) patients had variants leading to (partial) loss of exon 6 of the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes. One patient did not have a previously reported likely pathogenic COL1A1 variant. Data regarding management were retrieved. Hip surgery was performed in 5/12 patients and 3/12 patients underwent spinal surgery. As much as 4/12 patients were wheelchair-bound or unable to walk unaided. Fractures were present in 9/12 individuals with 1 patient requiring bisphosphonate treatment. Echocardiograms were performed in 10 patients and 2 individuals showed an abnormality likely unrelated to aEDS. One patient gave birth to two affected children and went through preterm labor requiring medication but had no additional complications. Of the seven adults in our cohort, the majority entered a career. Our data point toward a genotype-phenotype relationship with individuals with aEDS due to pathogenic COL1A1 variants causing complete or partial loss of exon 6 being more severely affected regarding musculoskeletal features. There is a significant lack of knowledge with regard to management of aEDS, particularly in adulthood. As such, systematic follow-up and multidisciplinary treatment is essential.","[Ayoub, Sandy; Ghali, Neeti; Angwin, Chloe; Brady, Angela F.; Pope, F.

Despite many attempts, water activation accompanied with a change in the coordination geometry of Zn2+ in complexes remains a challenge. In this study, we discover a new structure that is composed of partially protonated zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc), hydroxide ion, and tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane (TPFB). The coordination of TPFB with water bounded with ZnPc results in the dissociation of water, and the dissociated proton from water moves to one nitrogen atom of the phthalocyanine ring through the intramolecular proton transfer. On the basis of this reaction, the coordination geometry transforms from a five-coordinated to a distorted tetrahedral species.

The UV irradiation increases the basic hydroxyl groups on the titania surface, which accepts protons from the water molecules or proton donors on the surface and has a positive charge.","[Nishikiori, Hiromasa; Kondo, Hayato; Kageshima, Yosuke; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem Mat, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nishikiori, Hiromasa; Kageshima, Yosuke; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, RISM, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nishikiori, Hiromasa; Hooshmand, Nasrin; Panikkanvalappil, Sajanlal R.; Valverde-Chavez, David A.; Silva, Carlos; El-Sayed, Mostafa A.] Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA","Nishikiori, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem Mat, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Nishikiori, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, RISM, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Nishikiori, H; El-Sayed, MA (reprint author), Georgia Inst Technol, Sch Chem & Biochem, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",nishiki@shinshu-u.ac.jp; melsayed@gatech.edu,"Kageshima, Yosuke/E-5508-2018","Kageshima, Yosuke/0000-0003-4919-9447; Silva Acuna, Carlos/0000-0002-3969-5271","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP15K05472, JP16KK0110]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant numbers JP15K05472 and JP16KK0110.,,30,0,0,1,1,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1932-7447,1932-7455,,J PHYS CHEM C,J.

The lead zirconate titanate/shape memory polyurethane nanofibers were used to harvest energy from sinusoidal vibrations, and the lead zirconate titanate 80 wt% sample produced voltages of 120.3 mV (peak-to-peak).

In this study, we report that a micro carbon wire grows in the direction opposite to the electric field selectively from a graphite rod in water between parallel electrodes under a DC electric field. Surprisingly, this self-assembled method does not require any preparation for the suspension of carbon materials and it can control the growing position and direction at the same time. Furthermore, we find that the wiring growth rate is approximately proportional to the square of the applied electric field, whereas the wiring phenomenon is not observed under an AC electric field. In addition, the wire grows not from a carbonaceous material but from a graphitic material. Based on these results, we propose that our self-wiring phenomenon occurs owing to the interlayer coupling through the positive (metal) ions in the electric double layer at the growth point, resulting from an induced charge electro-kinetic phenomenon and chemical reactions. We believe that our findings contribute greatly to a new class of microwires.","[Sugioka, Hideyuki; Ishikawa, Masato; Kado, Taiki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Sugioka, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",hsugioka@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,PHYSICAL SOC JAPAN,TOKYO,"YUSHIMA URBAN BUILDING 5F, 2-31-22 YUSHIMA, BUNKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113-0034, JAPAN",0031-9015,,,J PHYS SOC JPN,J.

Although much effort has been put into revealing the excellent physical properties of SWCNTs in conventional Cu-based materials, the aggregation/bundles of SWCNTs induced by strong van der Waals interaction complicates the preparation of Cu/SWCNT and has been still challenging to solve. In this work, we tried to prepare Cu/SWCNT composites using an electroplating technique based on co-deposition. Utilizing not only cationic surfactant trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (STAC) but also an atomization process involving shear stress, SWCNTs were successfully immobilized inside a Cu metal matrix to form a Cu/SWCNT sheet without significant loss of crystallinity for SWCNTs, which was confirmed by using Raman spectroscopy. A multi-layered Cu-Cu/SWCNT-Cu foil with an intermediate thickness of 4 mu m exhibited higher mechanical properties of 519 MPa strength and approximately 10% elongation compared to that of an electroplated Cu foil without SWCNTs. This is probably because cross-linking SWCNTs strongly immobilized between Cu crystals suppressed further crack generation by increasing fracture resistance. The obtained results indicate that this electroplating method is a promising way to prepare Cu/SWCNT composites. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Effective manipulation of the skyrmion motion is a vital task for realizing skyrmion-based applications. Skyrmion motion driven by voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) has been proposed, of which the investigation is mostly focused on the dynamics of skyrmions. Here, using micromagnetic simulations we show that antiskyrmions can be effectively driven by the VCMA gradient in the presence of the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that the antiskyrmion shows a transverse motion, i.e., the skyrmion Hall effect, induced by the VCMA gradient. As the skyrmion number of an antiskyrmion is opposite to that of a skyrmion, the anisotropy gradient-induced motion of ferromagnetically coupled skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair and antiferromagnetically coupled skyrmion-skyrmion and antiskyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs do not show the skyrmion Hall effect. We find that the velocity-driving force relations of these three combinations are different.

However, the effects of ALT treatment on reproductive tracts, including the ovaries, oviducts and uterus have not been yet clarified. In this study, we examined the expression of genes involved in endometrial responses in ALT-treated sows. ALT did not significantly alter luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol profiles in blood compared to untreated control. Quantitative RT-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the expression of genes encoding galectin-3 (LGALS3) and fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) was upregulated in the reproductive tracts of ALT-treated sows, including the ovaries, oviducts and uteri. Moreover, ALT treatment induced the expression of FGF9 and galectin-3 proteins, and promoted their localization to the luminal epithelium of the oviducts and uterus. Our findings suggest that the enhancement of reproductive performance shown by ALT-treated sows is associated with the upregulation of galectin-3 and FGF9, which are essential for endometrial receptivity, successful implantation, and pregnancy.","[Baek, Sun-Young; Sa, Soo-Jin; Jeong, Young-Dae; Cho, Eun-Seuk; Hong, Jun-Gi; KIm, Young-Shin; Cho, Kyu-Ho-; Chung, Hak-Jae] Natl Inst Anim Sci, Swine Sci Div, 114,Sinbang 1 Gil, Cheonan Si 31000, South Korea; [Park, Seol-Hwa] Natl Inst Anim Sci, Planning & Coordinat Div, Cheonan Si, South Korea; [Kim, Kyung-Woon; Lee, Hwi-Cheul] Natl Inst Anim Sci, Anim Biotechnol Div, Iseo Myeon, South Korea; [Hochi, Shinichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Lee, Seunghwan; Choi, Inchul] Chungnam Natl Univ, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Div Anim & Dairy Sci, Daejeon, South Korea","Chung, HJ (reprint author), Natl Inst Anim Sci, Swine Sci Div, 114,Sinbang 1 Gil, Cheonan Si 31000, South Korea.; Choi, I (reprint author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Swine Sci Div Anim & Dairy Sci, Coll Agr & Life Sci, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.",icchoi@cnu.ac.kr; hakjaena@korea.kr,,"Hochi, Shinichi/0000-0001-5315-3471",Korean Rural Developmental Administration [01359301],This work was supported by the Korean Rural Developmental Administration under Grant number [01359301].,,24,0,0,4,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1049-5398,1532-2378,,ANIM BIOTECHNOL,Anim.

We investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers related to the pathogenesis of ANCA-related HP (ANCA-HP). Methods The levels of B cell activation factor of the tumor necrosis factor family (BAFF), a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the CSF were compared between patients with ANCA-HP (n = 12), other types of immune-mediated HP (other HP; n = 12), multiple sclerosis (MS; n = 14), and non-inflammatory neurological disorders (NIND; n = 10). In addition, we evaluated whether ANCA would be detected in CSF. Results CSF levels of BAFF, APRIL, and TGF-beta 1 were significantly increased in ANCA-HP and other HP. In particular, BAFF and APRIL levels were significantly correlated with the IgG index in ANCA-HP. In other HP, BAFF and APRIL levels were significantly correlated with cell counts and protein levels in CSF. Of 12 patients with ANCA-HP, the CSF of 7 patients (58%) tested positive for myeloperoxidase (MPO)- or proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA, while none of the CSF samples from other HP, MS, or NIND patients tested positive. Conclusion The levels of BAFF, APRIL, and TGF-beta 1 may serve as useful CSF biomarkers for assessing the disease activity of immune-mediated HP. Moreover, BAFF and APRIL in the CSF may be implicated in the pathogenesis of ANCA-HP via promoting autoreactive B cells, while detecting MPO- or PR3-ANCA in the CSF may be found in some patients with ANCA-HP.","[Ikeda, Junji; Shimojima, Yasuhiro; Ueno, Ken-ichi; Kishida, Dai; Sekijima, Yoshiki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Neurol & Rheumatol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Usami, Yoko] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sekijima, Yoshiki] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Shimojima, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Neurol & Rheumatol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",yshimoji@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Health and Labour Sciences Research Grant on Rare and Intractable Diseases (Evidence-based Ear ly Diagnos); Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan","This study was supported by a Health and Labour Sciences Research Grant on Rare and Intractable Diseases (Evidence-based Ear ly Diagnos is and Treatment Strategies for Neuroimmunological Diseases) from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan.",,46,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",0770-3198,1434-9949,,CLIN RHEUMATOL,Clin.

Ball milling exfoliation of 2D materials has been rarely used, in spite of a promising dry phase production method, because of the superficial information in the mechanism and the effect of the operating parameters on the yield, size and thickness. Here, we investigate systematically the ball milling operating parameters in the exfoliation of bulk MoS2 in the presence of sodium cholate (SC) as an exfoliant. The yield and dimensions of the exfoliated MoS2 nanosheet were monitored by changing the parameters such as the weight ratio of bulk MoS2 and SC (SC/MoS2), the filling ratio in the volume of milling ball and container (?), milling ball size (d(B)), milling revolution speed (n(R)), and initial mass of bulk MoS2 (mMoS2<i). The yield of exfoliation is found to be 95% at the optimum ball milling conditions (SC/MoS(2)50%, mMoS2<i =;0.20 g). In addition, yield and size of the exfoliated MoS2 were controlled by the conditions of the ball milling. As for the evaluation of the exfoliated MoS2, we developed a novel method by use of the XRD profile to determine the size and thickness of the ball-milled MoS2 powder with less than 30% difference from those determined by the well-known absorption method. Finally, the size and thickness of the MoS2 nanosheets prepared by ball milling exfoliation were correlated with their electrocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities.","[Tayyebi, Ahmad; Ogino, Naoko; Komatsu, Naoki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Hayashi, Takuya] Shinshu Univ, Res Inst Supra Mat, Carbon Sci Div, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Komatsu, N (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Human & Environm Studies, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",komatsu.naoki.7w@kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Tayyebi, Ahmad/AAF-1461-2020","Tayyebi, Ahmad/0000-0003-1971-0603",JSPS Japan-Russia Bilateral Joint Research Program [17F17335];  [P17335],We thank Professor Teppei Yoshida and Dr Daiki Ootsuki for XPS measurements.

Materials and Methods: High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the multilayer structure of MWCNT with an average layer distance of 0.36 nm, which was not altered by nitrogen doping: the nanomaterials had similar widths and lengths. In vitro studies with THP-1 cells and alveolar macrophages from C57BL/6 mice demonstrated that NDMWCNT were less cytotoxic and stimulated less IL-1 beta release compared to MWCNT. For in vivo studies, male C57BL/6J mice received a single dose of dispersion medium (DM), 2.5, 10 or 40 mu g/mouse of NDMWCNT, or 40 mu g/mouse of MWCNT by oropharyngeal aspiration. Animals were euthanized between 1 and 7 days post-exposure for whole lung lavage (WLL) studies. Results and Discussion: NDMWCNT caused time- and dose-dependent pulmonary inflammation. However, it was less than that caused by MWCNT. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome was assessed in particle-exposed mice by determining cytokine production in WLL fluid at 1 day post-exposure. Compared to DM-exposed mice, IL-1 beta and IL-18 were significantly increased in MWCNT- and NDMWCNT-exposed mice, but the increase caused by NDMWCNT was less than MWCNT. At 56 days post-exposure, histopathology determined lung fibrosis in MWCNT-exposed mice was greater than NDMWCNT-exposed mice. Conclusions: These data indicate nitrogen doping of MWCNT decreases their bioactivity, as reflected with lower in vitro and in vivo toxicity inflammation and lung disease. The lower activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome may be responsible.","[Porter, Dale W.; Orandle, Marlene; Chen, Bean T.; Andrew, Michael; Wolfarth, Michael G.; Battelli, Lori] NIOSH, Hlth Effects Lab Div, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA; [Zheng, Peng; Wu, Nianqiang] West Virginia Univ, Dept Mech & Aerosp Engn, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Hamilton, Raymond F., Jr.; Holian, Andrij] Univ Montana, Ctr Environm Hlth Sci, Missoula, MT 59812 USA; [Tsuruoka, Shuji; Terrones, Mauricio] Shinshu Univ, Res Ctr Exot Nanocarbons, Nagano, Japan; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, 104 Davey Lab, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Ctr 2 Dimens & Layered Mat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Castranova, Vince] West Virginia Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA","Porter, DW (reprint author), NIOSH, Pathol & Physiol Res Branch, Hlth Effects Lab Div, 1095 Willowdale Rd,M-S 2015, Morgantown, WV 26505 USA.",DPorter@cdc.gov,,"Holian, Andrij/0000-0003-0072-4538",,,,33,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0895-8378,1091-7691,,INHAL TOXICOL,Inhal.

The electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) system has expanded indications for CI to include patients with residual hearing, and is currently becoming a standard therapy for these patients. Genetic disorders are known to be the most common cause of congenital/early-onset sensorineural hearing loss, and are also involved in a considerable proportion of cases of late-onset hearing loss. There has been a great deal of progress in the identification of deafness genes over the last two decades. Currently, more than 100 genes have been reported to be associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. Patients possessing a variety of deafness gene mutations have achieved satisfactory auditory performance after CI/EAS, suggesting that identification of the genetic background facilitates prediction of post-CI/EAS performance. When the intra-cochlear etiology is associated with a specific genetic background, there is a potential for good CI performance. Thus, it is essential to determine which region of the cochlea is affected by identifying the responsible genes. This review summarizes the genetic background of the patients receiving CI/EAS, and introduces detailed clinical data and CI/EAS outcomes in representative examples. Anat Rec, 2020.

The peculiar reversible double-stimulus responsive wettability of the DSR-CZPP can be modulated by triggering hydrophilic/hydrophobic transitions and lipophilic./oleophobic transitions under dual-stimulations of pH and UV light irradiation. The special molecular structure of the triblock polymer brushes enabled DSR-CZPP to intelligent modulation of oil-water separation under the control of ''UV & pH double switch"", meanwhile CNC/ZnO simultaneously can induce the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes. Moreover, DSR-CZPP can have high removal ratios of various pollutants, such as metal ion (Cu2+) and toxic organic solvent (silicone oil, acetone and chloroform).

Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as promising candidates for N anion exchangers using the interlayer nanospace in their crystal structures. Miyata reported in 1983 that the affinity of anions for intercalation with most major Mg-Al LDHs increased in the following order: NO3- < Br- < F- < SO42- < HPO32-. Attempts to alter the affinity with different metal cations (M2+ and M3+) have been unsuccessful. Analyses of the crystalline structures of LDHs, positively charged host layers, interlayer anions, and interlayer water molecules indicate that they inevitably interact through hydrogen bonding. words, the affinity of LDHs for anions is controlled by tuning the hydrogen bonding. In this study, we prepared fluorine-substituted LDHs (F-LDHs) with different Mg/Al ratios by partially replacing the OH structural groups, which originated from the host layer, with fluorine atoms; the resulting change in affinity was investigated. The distribution coefficient, which is a useful indicator of the affinity of an LDH for a particular anion, was examined. The results showed that only F-LDHs with Mg/ Al ratios of 3.5 exhibited high affinity, especially for NO3- ions, and the affinity increased in the following order: HPO32- < SO42- < F- < Br- < NO3-. The separation factors of these specific F-LDHs with respect to both NO3-/F- and NO3-/SO42- were higher than that of LDHs with other compositions by 1 order of magnitude. Raman spectroscopy above 3000 cm(-1) revealed that the fluorine substitution of LDHs significantly changed the hydrogen bonding nature in the interlayer space. Highly electronegative fluorine atoms significantly decrease the extent of hydrogen bonding interactions between OH structural groups and both interlayer water molecules and anions, wherein steric effects are induced by the shrunken interlayer space, and van der Waals forces are revealed to be the predominant interaction with anions. Therefore, the highest affinity was observed for NO3- ions in F-LDHs.","[Sudare, Tomohito; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Kiyama, Masahiro; Hayashi, Fumitaka; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Dubois, Marc] Univ Clermont Auvergne, SIGMA Clermont, UMR CNRS 6296, 24 Ave Blaise Pascal, F-63178 Aubire, France; [Louvain, Nicolas] Univ Montpellier, CNRS, Inst Charles Gerhardt Montpellier, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Louvain, Nicolas] CNRS, FR 3459, Reseau Stockage Electrochim Energie RS2E, 33 Rue St Leu, F-80039 Amiens, France","Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",teshima@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"HAYASHI, Fumitaka/I-5366-2014","HAYASHI, Fumitaka/0000-0002-4494-739X","A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology project of the ""Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sci; Matching Planner Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [5RF-1902]","This work was partially supported by the ""A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology"" project of the ""Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan, the Matching Planner Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and Environment Research and Technology Development Fund 5RF-1902 of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan.

The Young's modulus and stress at break decreased with an increase in electrolyte concentration in the coagulation bath; however, they recovered upon washing the fibers with water and subsequent drying. The maximum Young's modulus and stress at break values were 18.6 +/- 2.4 GPa and 109 +/- 3.8 MPa for the cotton nanowhisker fibers and 18.1 +/- 2.7 GPa and 141 +/- 19.5 MPa for the tunicin nanowhisker fibers, respectively. The higher crystal integrity and higher aspect ratio of the tunicin nanowhiskers as compared with those of the cotton nanowhiskers resulted in higher mechanical properties. The carboxylated nanowhiskers obtained by TEMPO-mediated surface oxidation yielded fibers with higher mechanical properties than those of sulfated nanowhisker fibers upon spinning, probably due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nanowhiskers.","[Araki, Jun] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Araki, Jun] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Div Biol & Med Fibers, ICCER, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Miyayama, Masahiro] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Araki, J (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",jun@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP17K05991]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP17K05991.,,27,0,0,9,9,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0032-3861,1873-2291,,POLYMER,Polymer,3-Feb,2020,188,,,,,,,,122116,10.1016/j.polymer.2019.122116,,,8,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,KK8RG,WOS:000513003200012,,,,,2020/4/20

However, pristine PP fibrous membranes show poor flexibility, which limits their advanced functional application in medical and healthcare. Therefore, to improve the flexibility of PP fibrous membranes, propylene-based elastomer (PBE), a copolymer compatible with PP, was introduced by using the melt blowing technique in this study. The SEM images show that the PP/PBE fibrous membrane samples expressed a binary structured network morphology consisting of fibers with a diameter distribution ranging from 0.4 to 15 mu m. With an increase in PBE mass ratio from 15 to 80 wt%, the frequency of fibers with a diameter <3 mu m increased from 48.6 to 61.2%, thus making the elastic recovery rate in the machine direction (MD) increase from 62.9 to 80.3% and softness values increase from 15.88 to 54.31.

This study aimed to identify the effects and therapeutic mechanism of CRT on the improvement of detrusor overactivity (DO) using an experimental rat model. Forty-five female Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into three groups: intravesical saline instillation with normal food (normal group), intravesical acetic acid (AA) instillation with normal food (AA group), and intravesical AA instillation with CRT (AA with CRT group). To induce a decrease in bladder capacity, instillation of 0.2% AA was used based on prior studies. Cystometric investigation was employed to clarify the effects of AA and CRT. Microcirculation was performed using a laser blood flowmeter, and the localization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1 alpha) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The bladder capacities of the normal, AA, and AA with CRT groups were 1.2 +/- 0.3 mL, 0.4 +/- 0.1 mL, and 0.8 +/- 0.1 mL, respectively. CRT significantly attenuated AA irritation of the urinary bladder and exerted protective effects on basal pressure, micturition pressure, micturition interval, and micturition volume. Furthermore, CRT could prevent the excess blood flow and edematous change under the urothelium induced by intravesical AA instillation. No obvious changes in immunohistochemical HIF1 alpha staining were observed among the groups. CRT attenuated DO induced by intravesical AA instillation in a rat experimental model.

Increased and decreased mechanical loading induces hypertrophy and atrophy of cardiomyocytes, respectively. In physiological conditions, these structural changes of the heart are reversible. However, chronic stresses such as hypertension or cancer cachexia cause irreversible remodeling of the heart, leading to heart failure. Accumulating evidence indicates that calcium dyshomeostasis and aberrant reactive oxygen species production cause pathological heart remodeling. Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) is a nonselective cation channel subfamily whose multimodal activation or modulation of channel activity play important roles in a plethora of cellular physiology. Roles of TRPC channels in cardiac physiology have been reported in pathological cardiac remodeling. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding the importance of TRPC channels in flexible cardiac remodeling (i.e., cardiac plasticity) in response to environmental stresses and discuss questions that should be addressed in the near future.","[Numaga-Tomita, Takuro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Nishida, Motohiro] Natl Inst Nat Sci, NIPS, Div Cardiocirculatory Signaling, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Nishida, Motohiro] Natl Inst Nat Sci, Exploratory Res Ctr Life & Living Syst ExCELLS, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan; [Nishida, Motohiro] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan","Numaga-Tomita, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Mol Pharmacol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Nishida, M (reprint author), Natl Inst Nat Sci, NIPS, Div Cardiocirculatory Signaling, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan.; Nishida, M (reprint author), Natl Inst Nat Sci, Exploratory Res Ctr Life & Living Syst ExCELLS, Okazaki, Aichi 4448787, Japan.; Nishida, M (reprint author), Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Fukuoka 8128582, Japan.",ta96tomita@shinshu-u.ac.jp; nishida@nips.ac.jp,,"Nishida, Motohiro/0000-0002-2587-5458","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K15585]; Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Research in a Proposed Research Area) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan [18H04993]; Exploratory Research Center on Life and Living Systems (ExCELLS); ExCELLS program [19-316]","This research was funded by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant No. 17K15585 to T.N-T.) and Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Research in a Proposed Research Area 18H04993 `Living in Space' to T.N-T.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan, and supported by Joint Research by Exploratory Research Center on Life and Living Systems (ExCELLS).

This so-called Sandage-Loeb test offers a direct measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. However, acceleration in the motion of the Solar System with respect to the cosmic microwave background also changes redshifts measured at multiple epochs. If not accounted for, it yields a biased cosmological inference. To address this, we calculate the acceleration of the Solar System with respect to the Local Group of galaxies to quantify the change in the measured redshift due to local motion. Our study is motivated by the recent determination of the mass of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which indicates a significant fraction of the Milky Way mass. We find that the acceleration towards the Galactic Center dominates, which gives a redshift change of 7 cm s(-1) in 10yr, while the accelerations due to the LMC and M 31 cannot be ignored, depending on lines of sight. We create all-sky maps of the expected change in redshift and the corresponding uncertainty, which can be used to correct for this effect.","[Inoue, Takuya] Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Mech Engn, 1-3 Tatara Miyakodani, Kyoto, Kyoto 6100394, Japan; [Inoue, Takuya] Ecole Cent Lille, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Inoue, Takuya; Komatsu, Eiichiro] Max Planck Inst Astrophys, Karl Schwarzschild Str 1, D-85741 Garching, Germany; [Komatsu, Eiichiro] Univ Tokyo Kavli IPMU WPI, Todai Inst Adv Study, Kavli Inst Phys & Math Universe, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778583, Japan; [Aoki, Wako; Usuda, Tomonori] Natl Astron Observ Japan, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Aoki, Wako; Usuda, Tomonori] Grad Univ Adv Studies, Sch Phys Sci, Dept Astron Sci, SOKENDAI, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 1818588, Japan; [Chiba, Takeshi] Nihon Univ, Coll Humanities & Sci, Dept Phys, Setagaya Ku, 3-25-40 Sakurajosui, Tokyo 1568550, Japan; [Misawa, Toru] Shinshu Univ, Sch Gen Educ, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Inoue, T (reprint author), Doshisha Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Dept Mech Engn, 1-3 Tatara Miyakodani, Kyoto, Kyoto 6100394, Japan.; Inoue, T (reprint author), Ecole Cent Lille, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.; Inoue, T; Komatsu, E (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Astrophys, Karl Schwarzschild Str 1, D-85741 Garching, Germany.; Komatsu, E (reprint author), Univ Tokyo Kavli IPMU WPI, Todai Inst Adv Study, Kavli Inst Phys & Math Universe, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778583, Japan.",ctwc0518@mail4.doshisha.ac.jp; komatsu@mpa-garching.mpg.de,,,"JSPS KAKENHI GrantMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP15H05894, JP15H05896]; Japan Public-Private Partnership Student Study Abroad Program-TOBITATE!

The 3D bluff body model tested in this study was composed of a quarter sphere and a half cylinder, and the Reynolds number based on the diameter of half cylinder was set at 1.3 x 10(4). The modulation drive was adopted for flow control, and the control effects of variations in dimensionless burst frequency (f(m)(+)) normalized by the width of the model and freestream velocity were studied. Velocity distributions analyzed by particle image velocimetry showed that the recirculation region behind the model shrank due to the flow control. The static pressure distributions on the back surface of the model tended to decrease under any f(m)(+) set in this study, especially in the ranges of 0.40 <= f(m)(+) <= 0.64. The drag coefficient reached its maximum value under the similar ranges of f(m)(+). Although the aerodynamic wake sharpening was observed due to the flow control, the entrainment of separated flow into the back surface of the model was enhanced. This scenario of wake manipulation was considered to be responsible for increasing drag acting on the model.","[Matsubara, Takatoshi; Shima, Yoshiki] Tokyo Univ Sci, Grad Sch Engn, Tokyo 1258585, Japan; [Matsubara, Takatoshi; Shima, Yoshiki; Segawa, Takehiko] Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Energy Conservat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058564, Japan; [Aono, Hikaru; Ishikawa, Hitoshi] Tokyo Univ Sci, Dept Mech Engn, Tokyo 1258585, Japan; [Aono, Hikaru] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Segawa, T (reprint author), Natl Inst Adv Ind Sci & Technol, Res Inst Energy Conservat, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058564, Japan.",4518556@ed.tus.ac.jp; 4519528@ed.tus.ac.jp; aono@shinshu-u.ac.jp; ishi@rs.tus.ac.jp; t-segawa@aist.go.jp,,,,,,33,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1073,,ENERGIES,Energies,FEB,2020,13,4,,,,,,,872,10.3390/en13040872,,,20,Energy & Fuels,Energy & Fuels,KY3TB,WOS:000522492700100,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020/4/20

However, the dependency on human evaluators to grade the ripeness of oil palm fresh fruit bunches (FFBs) by traditional means could lead to inaccuracy that can cause a reduction in oil palm fruit oil extraction rate (OER). This paper emphasizes the fruit battery method to distinguish oil palm fruit FFB ripeness stages by determining the value of load resistance voltage and its moisture content resolution. In addition, computer vision using a color feature is tested on the same samples to compare the accuracy score using support vector machine (SVM). The accuracy score results of the fruit battery, computer vision, and a combination of both methods' accuracy scores are evaluated and compared. When the ripe and unripe samples were tested for load resistance voltage ranging from 10 Omega to 10 k Omega, three resistance values were shortlisted and tested for moisture content resolution evaluation. A 1 k Omega load resistance showed the best moisture content resolution, and the results were used for accuracy score evaluation comparison with computer vision. From the results obtained, the accuracy scores for the combination method are the highest, followed by the fruit battery and computer vision methods.","[Aliteh, Nor Aziana; Minakata, Kaiko; Tashiro, Kunihisa; Wakiwaka, Hiroyuki; Kobayashi, Kazuki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nagata, Hirokazu] Shinshu Univ, Global Educ Ctr, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Misron, Norhisam] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia","Tashiro, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",aziana.teh@gmail.com; mnktsilkukoika@gmail.com; tashiro@shinshu-u.ac.jp; wakiwak@shinshu-u.ac.jp; kby@shinshu-u.ac.jp; hnagata@shinshu-u.ac.jp; norhisam@upm.edu.my,,"tashiro, kunihisa/0000-0003-0793-882X",,,,18,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,FEB,2020,20,3,,,,,,,637,10.3390/s20030637,,,14,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,KR7HH,WOS:000517786200061,31979252,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

The effect of the cooling rate on the shapes of the NbSe2 thin flakes, for example, hexagons and triangles, was studied. In particular, rapid cooling after selenization of the deposited Nb film was found to be effective for growing triangular NbSe2 flakes. Raman spectroscopy of one sample prepared by rapid cooling revealed an unidentified vibration peak in addition to the prominent characteristic peaks of 2H-NbSe2. The Ti film could only be selenized by using sodium chloride as a transport agent, which resulted in the growth of TiSe2 thin flakes having a half-hexagonal shape without the incorporation of residual materials. Temperature-dependent resistances measurement, including the measurements of the temperature of maximum resistance and R-max/R-293K ratio, indicated a conventional charge-density wave transition in the TiSe2 thin flakes.

Sulfurization of metallic precursors is one of the most promising preparation processes for this optical absorber because it is considered favorable from a productivity viewpoint. Two types of precursors were studied in this paper. One was a multiple stack of pure metal layers and the other was an alloy layer with or without an overlayer consisting of pure metal. By investigating how the stacking sequence of each metallic precursor layer and a heating rate for sulfurization had an influence on the formation of secondary phases on the CTZS surface and also in the bulk, we found that the sulfurization process of Zn-covered metallic precursors had a beneficial effect on the improvement of device performance.

Both treatments indicate positive outcome for removing SnS2 impurity crystals precipitated on the surface of the CZTS thin films. In addition, both treatments were found effective in dissolution of Sn-based secondary phases mainly from Sn-rich CZTS. By Na2S etching, spectral response at short wavelength of the thin film solar cell is enhanced, while that of the wavelength region of 500-700 nm is degraded. On the other hand, post-annealing improved the spectral response in this wavelength region, and subsequent etching did not degrade the spectral response. By applying an annealing treatment followed by Na2S etching, the spectral response was improved in both short and long wavelength regions and the photovoltaic conversion efficiency over 4% was realized. This treatment process was especially effective in the Sn-rich CZTS absorption layer, and hence open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and fill factor were greatly enhanced compared with the other treatments procedure.

Hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) is an important complication of immunosuppressive drug therapy. It can occur via both virological and host factors; however, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Methods. We examined serum samples derived from patients with HBVr and those with acute hepatitis B (AHB). The targeted nucleic acid molecule in hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid was amplified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Results. The percentage of patients infected with genotype Bj among the HBVr patients was significantly higher than that in the AHB patients. The frequency of mutation sites in the whole HBV genome, especially in the envelope region, in the HBVr was significantly higher than that in the AHB. The prevalence of the S3N amino acid substitution in the envelope protein and mutations at positions G1896A and G1899A in the precore region were significantly higher in the HBVr compared with AHB. The population of S3N amino acid substitution and nucleotide G1896A and G1899A mutations in each individual showed a similar percentage of occurrence. Conclusions. We identified specific virological factors in patients with HBVr through ultradeep sequencing. Our findings could be beneficial for the elucidation of mechanisms underlying HBVr development and for disease control.","[Sakamoto, Kazumasa; Ito, Kiyoaki; Okumura, Akinori; Yoneda, Masashi] Aichi Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan; [Umemura, Takeji; Joshita, Satoru; Ota, Masao; Tanaka, Eiji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med, Div Hepatol & Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Umemura, Takeji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Sakamoto, Kazumasa; Sugiyama, Masaya; Mizokami, Masashi] Natl Ctr Global Hlth & Med, Res Ctr Hepatitis & Immunol, Ichikawa, Japan","Ito, K (reprint author), Aichi Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, 1-1 Yazakokarimata, Nagakute, Aichi 4801195, Japan.",kito@aichi-med-u.ac.jp,,,Japanese Association of Medical Sciences; AMED [JP19fk0310118]; Japanese Society of Gastroenterology GrantJapanese Society of Gastroenterology;  [JP16K09380],"This work was supported by Grants-in-Aid of the 24th General Assembly of the Japanese Association of Medical Sciences, Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research Grant number JP16K09380, AMED under Grant Number JP19fk0310118 and The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology Grant.",,25,2,2,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0022-1899,1537-6613,,J INFECT DIS,J.

Although a considerable number of heterogenized catalysts are available, to the best of our knowledge, there is no efficient and reusable heterogenized catalyst reported for asymmetric reactions to date. Herein, we prepared a [RuCl2(eta(6)-p-cymene)]/chiralthiourea ligand covalently bonded to graphene nanosheets (G-CLRu(II), where G represents graphene oxide (GO), CL denotes chiral N-((1-phenylethyl)carbamothioyl)acetamide and Ru(II) symbolizes [RuCl2(eta(6)-p-cymene)]), for the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones. Five simple steps were involved in the preparation of the G-CLRu(II) catalyst. The structure of G-CLRu(II) was investigated by means of various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. Coordination mode and covalent bonding involved in the G-CLRu(II) structure we reconfirmed. G-CLRu(II) demonstrated good catalytic performance towards the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones (conversion of up to 95%, enantiomeric excesses (ee) of up to 99%, and turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) values of 535.9 and 22.3 h(-1), respectively). A possible mechanism is proposed for the G-CLRu(II)-catalyzed asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of ketones. Recovery (similar to 95%), reusability (fifth cycle, yield of 89% and ee of 81%), and stability of G-CLRu(II) were found to be good. We believe that the present stepwise preparation of G-CLRu(II) opens a new door for designing various metal-centered heterogenized chiral catalysts for asymmetric synthesis.","[Mayakrishnan, Gopiraman; Min, Chung Ill] Konkuk Univ, Coll Sanghur Life Sci, Dept Crop Sci, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Soo, Kim Ick] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Div Frontier Fibers, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp,ICCER, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Min, CI (reprint author), Konkuk Univ, Coll Sanghur Life Sci, Dept Crop Sci, 120 Neungdong Ro, Seoul 05029, South Korea.",gopiramannitt@gmail.com; kimicksoo.gr@gmail.com; imcim@konkuk.ac.kr,,,Konkuk University's KU research professor program,This study was supported by Konkuk University's KU research professor program.,,53,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4344,,CATALYSTS,Catalysts,FEB,2020,10,2,,,,,,,175,10.3390/catal10020175,,,21,"Chemistry, Physical",Chemistry,KU8XV,WOS:000519998900033,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020/4/20

In this report we designed a unique method to crosslink polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) nanofiber to enhance its adsorption capacity against metal ions like Copper (Cu2+) and Lead (Pb2+). PVA nanofibers were crosslinked by conventional method using glutaraldehyde vapors and also by solution method (self-designed). Morphological properties were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) which confirmed uniform morphology of nanofiber membranes. Thermal degradation analysis was done using thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). Mechanical properties were also improved significantly in case of solution crosslinked PVA nanofibers. X-Ray diffraction results showed that crystallinity was also increased when nanofibers were crosslinked using solution method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to check bonding of hydroxyl group in the result of crosslinking and it was confirmed that more hydroxyl groups were bound in case of solution crosslinked PVA nanofibers. Adsorption capacity for copper and lead ions was measured using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) atomic emission spectrometer and it was concluded from adsorption data that solution crosslinked PVA nanofibers were far efficient as compared to that of uncrosslinked and vapor crosslinked nanofibers. Equilibrium time was decreased significantly which gives credibility of process with efficient removal of metal ions in shorter time.,"[Ullah, Sana; Hashmi, Motahira; Hussain, Nadir; Ullah, Azeem; Sarwar, Muhammad Nauman; Saito, Yusuke; Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, Inst Frontier Fiber Engn, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Kim, Seong Hun] Hanyang Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Organ Nano Engn, Seoul, South Korea","Kim, IS (reprint author), 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,40,1,1,3,3,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7144,,,J WATER PROCESS ENG,J.

However, the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics for pediatric patients with solid tumors remains unclear. Methods We retrospectively assessed 103 neutropenic periods from 26 patients with neuroblastoma or brain tumors following three different intensity chemotherapy regimens (05A3, A, and B). While piperacillin was intravenously administered as prophylaxis (PIPC prophylaxis group), the historical control group received no prophylaxis. As patients exhibited a variable degree of myelosuppression based on the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen, we separately evaluated the frequency and severity of febrile neutropenia (FN) in each regimen. Results Following intensive chemotherapy, we observed a significantly lower frequency of FN in the PIPC prophylaxis group compared with the historical control group in both regimen 05A3 (20% vs 65%; P = 0.01) and regimen A (56% vs 93%; P = 0.02). We also observed a shorter duration of fever, lower maximum fever, and lower C-reactive protein levels in the PIPC prophylaxis group compared with the historical control group after regimens 05A3 and A. Conversely, the frequency and severity of FN were not different between the two groups after moderate-intensity chemotherapy (regimen B). However, a longitudinal routine surveillance study of Pseudomonas aeruginosa also indicated a reduction in the susceptibility to PIPC throughout the study period. Conclusions Although PIPC prophylaxis might provide an advantage for severe neutropenia in pediatric patients with solid tumors, there is concern regarding bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Therefore, further careful examination is necessary for adaptation.","[Saito, Shoji; Uchida, Eriko; Watanabe, Tatsuo; Komori, Kazutoshi; Kurata, Takashi; Sakashita, Kazuo] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Azumino, Japan; [Saito, Shoji; Yanagisawa, Ryu; Nakamura, Tomohiko; Sakashita, Kazuo] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Life Sci Res Ctr, Azumino, Japan; [Minami, Kisei] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Gen Pediat, Azumino, Japan; [Saito, Shoji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Ryu] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Div Blood Transfus, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Ryu] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Ctr Adv Cell Therapy, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Yanagisawa, R (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Div Blood Transfus, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",ryu@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18K15702]",,,22,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1328-8067,1442-200X,,PEDIATR INT,Pediatr.

Extensive studies have revealed conserved and unique molecular mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions across different plant species; however, most insights gleaned to date have been limited to seed plants. The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a descendant of early diverging land plants, is gaining in popularity as an advantageous model system to understand land plant evolution. However, studying evolutionary molecular plant-microbe interactions in this model is hampered by the small number of pathogens known to infect M. polymorpha. Here, we describe four pathogenic fungal strains, Irpex lacteus Marchantia-infectious (MI)1, Phaeophlebiopsis peniophoroides MI2, Bjerkandera adusta MI3 and B. adusta MI4, isolated from diseased M. polymorpha. We demonstrate that salicylic acid (SA) treatment of M. polymorpha promotes infection of the I. lacteus MI1 that is likely to adopt a necrotrophic lifestyle, while this effect is suppressed by co-treatment with the bioactive jasmonate in M. polymorpha, dinor-cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (dn-OPDA), suggesting that antagonistic interactions between SA and oxylipin pathways during plant-fungus interactions are ancient and were established already in liverworts.","[Matsui, Hidenori; Hyon, Gang-Su; Yotsui, Izumi; Nakagami, Hirofumi] RIKEN, CSRS, Plant Prote Res Unit, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan; [Iwakawa, Hidekazu; Nakagami, Hirofumi] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Basic Immune Syst Plants, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Katou, Shinpei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Minamiminowa 8304, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Monte, Isabel; Solano, Roberto] CSIC, CNB, Dept Plant Mol Genet, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Nishihama, Ryuichi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Franzen, Rainer] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Cent Microscopy, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Matsui, Hidenori] Okayama Univ, Grad Sch Environm & Life Sci, Okayama 7008530, Japan","Nakagami, H (reprint author), RIKEN, CSRS, Plant Prote Res Unit, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2300045, Japan.; Nakagami, H (reprint author), Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Basic Immune Syst Plants, D-50829 Cologne, Germany.",nakagami@mpipz.mpg.de,"Monte, Isabel/AAC-7062-2020; Nakagami, Hirofumi/A-4122-2011","Monte, Isabel/0000-0002-7058-8343; Nakagami, Hirofumi/0000-0003-2569-7062","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K07665]; Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation [BIO201677216-R]; Max-Planck-GesellschaftMax Planck Society",The Max-Planck-Gesellschaft to H.N.; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [17K07665 to S.K.]; and Spanish Ministry for Science and Innovation grant [BIO201677216-R (MINECO/FEDER) to R.S.].,,92,2,2,2,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,,PLANT CELL PHYSIOL,Plant Cell Physiol.,FEB,2020,61,2,,,,,265,275,,10.1093/pcp/pcz187,,,11,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,KS8JE,WOS:000518552100005,31560390,,,,2020/4/20

In boreal forests, over one-third of net primary production is allocated to roots. Pioneer roots expand the horizontal and vertical root systems and transport nutrients and water from belowground to aboveground. Fibrous roots, often colonized by mycorrhiza, emerge from the pioneer roots and absorb water and nutrients from the soil. In this study, we installed three flatbed scanners to detect the daily growth of both pioneer and fibrous roots of Scots pine during the growing season of 2018, a year with an unexpected summer drought in Southern Finland. The growth rate of both types of roots had a positive relationship with temperature. However, the relations between root elongation rate and soil moisture differed significantly between scanners and between root types indicating spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture. The pioneer roots were more tolerant to severe environmental conditions than the fibrous roots. The pioneer roots initiated elongation earlier and ceased it later than the fibrous roots. Elongation ended when the temperature dropped below the threshold temperature of 4 degrees C for pioneer roots and 6 degrees C for fibrous roots. During the summer drought, the fibrous roots halted root surface area growth at the beginning of the drought, but there was no drought effect on the pioneer roots over the same period. To compare the timing of root production and the aboveground organs' production, we used the CASSIA model, which estimates the aboveground tree carbon dynamics. In this study, root growth started and ceased later than growth of aboveground organs. Pioneer roots accounted for 87% of total root productivity. We suggest that future carbon allocation models should separate the roots by root types (pioneer and fibrous), as their growth patterns are different and they have different reactions to changes in the soil environment.","[Ding, Yiyang; Schiestl-Aalto, Pauliina; Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko; Ryhti, Kira; Kulmala, Liisa] Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Schiestl-Aalto, Pauliina; Ryhti, Kira; Kulmala, Liisa] Univ Helsinki, Inst Atmospher Sci & Earth Syst Res INAR Forest S, POB 64, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Schiestl-Aalto, Pauliina] Swedish Univ Agr Sci SLU, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Skogens Ekol & Skotsel, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kulmala, Liisa] Finnish Meteorol Inst, POB 503, FI-00101 Helsinki, Finland","Ding, YY (reprint author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Forest Sci, POB 27, FI-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",yiyang.ding@helsinki.fi,"Ryhti, Kira/R-2173-2016","Ryhti, Kira/0000-0002-9006-5689; Kulmala, Liisa/0000-0003-1775-8240; Helmisaari, Helja-Sisko/0000-0002-3056-7820",China Scholarship Council-ChinaChina Scholarship Council [201506600040]; Knut and Alice Wallenberg FoundationKnut & Alice Wallenberg Foundation [2015.0047]; Academy of Finland Finnish Centre of Excellence Program [307331]; Kone Foundation; Finnish Society of Forest Sciences (SMS); Helsinki University Funds,"Financial support was provided by the China Scholarship Council (#201506600040)-China, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation (#2015.0047), the Academy of Finland Finnish Centre of Excellence Program (#307331), Kone Foundation, Helsinki University Funds and the Finnish Society of Forest Sciences (SMS).",,72,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0829-318X,1758-4469,,TREE PHYSIOL,Tree Physiol.,FEB,2020,40,2,,,,,272,283,,10.1093/treephys/tpz131,,,12,Forestry,Forestry,KS8JS,WOS:000518553500011,31860713,"Green Published, Other Gold",,,2020/4/20

Using this dimeric 4-helix bundle, we constructed a series of self-assembling supramolecular nanostructures including polyhedra and chain-type complexes. Here we describe the stabilization of WA20 by designing mutations that stabilize the helices and hydrophobic core. The redesigned proteins denature with substantially higher midpoints, with the most stable variant, called Super WA20 (SUWA), displaying an extremely high midpoint (T-m = 122 degrees C), much higher than the T-m of WA20 (75 degrees C). The crystal structure of SUWA reveals an intermolecularly folded dimer with bisecting U topology, similar to the parental WA20 structure, with two long alpha-helices of a protomer intertwined with the helices of another protomer. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the redesigned hydrophobic core in the center of SUWA significantly suppresses the deformation of helices observed in the same region of WA20, suggesting this is a critical factor stabilizing the SUWA structure. This hyperstable de novo protein is expected to be useful as nanoscale pillars of PN-Block components in new types of self-assembling nanoarchitectures.","[Arai, Ryoichi] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Biomol Innovat, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Arai, Ryoichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Supramol Complexes, Res Ctr Fungal & Microbial Dynamism, Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Kimura, Naoya; Arai, Ryoichi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Biol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Mochizuki, Kenji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem & Mat, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Mochizuki, Kenji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Umezawa, Koji] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Umezawa, Koji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hecht, Michael H.] Princeton Univ, Dept Chem, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA","Arai, R (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Biomol Innovat, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Arai, R (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Supramol Complexes, Res Ctr Fungal & Microbial Dynamism, Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Arai, R (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Biol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",rarai@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Mochizuki, Kenji/L-6385-2018","Mochizuki, Kenji/0000-0002-8947-9980; Arai, Ryoichi/0000-0001-5606-8483","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K05841, JP16H00761, JP24780097, JP17KK0104, JP19H02522]; IMS; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We sincerely thank Prof. Akihiko Yamagishi, Dr. Sota Yagi, and Mr. Takahiro Sasamoto at Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences and Prof. Satoshi Akanuma at Waseda University for help in CD experiments; Dr. Takahiro Kosugi, Dr. Rie Koga, and Dr. Nobuyasu Koga at Institute for Molecular Science (IMS) for assistance in SEC-MALS and CD experiments; Dr. Naoya Kobayashi at IMS, and Prof. Takaaki Sato, Mr. Kouichi Inano, and Dr. Keiichi Yanase at Shinshu University for help in SAXS analysis; Mr. Yusuke Koyanagi at Shinshu University and Dr. Keitaro Yamashita at University of Tokyo for help in installing MR-Rosetta.

Adrenomedullin (AM) is a multifunctional peptide regulated by receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). We previously reported that the AM-RAMP2 system is involved in tumor angiogenesis, but the function of the AM-RAMP3 system remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the actions of the AM-RAMP2 and 3 systems in the tumor microenvironment and their impact on metastasis. PAN02 pancreatic cancer cells were injected into the spleens of mice, leading to spontaneous liver metastasis. Tumor metastasis was enhanced in vascular endothelial cell-specific RAMP2 knockout mice (DI-E-RAMP2-/-). By contrast, metastasis was suppressed in RAMP3-/- mice, where the number of podoplanin (PDPN)-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) was reduced in the periphery of tumors at metastatic sites. Because PDPN-positive CAFs are a hallmark of tumor malignancy, we assessed the regulation of PDPN and found that Src/Cas/PDPN signaling is mediated by RAMP3. In fact, RAMP3 deficiency CAFs suppressed migration, proliferation, and metastasis in co-cultures with tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the activation of RAMP2 in RAMP3-/- mice suppressed both tumor growth and metastasis. Based on these results, we suggest that the upregulation of PDPN in DI-E-RAMP2-/- mice increases malignancy, while the downregulation of PDPN in RAMP3-/- mice reduces it. Selective activation of RAMP2 and inhibition of RAMP3 would therefore be expected to suppress tumor metastasis. This study provides the first evidence that understanding and targeting to AM-RAMP systems could contribute to the development of novel therapeutics against metastasis.","[Dai, Kun; Tanaka, Megumu; Kamiyoshi, Akiko; Sakurai, Takayuki; Ichikawa-Shindo, Yuka; Kawate, Hisaka; Cui, Nanqi; Wei, Yangxuan; Tanaka, Masaaki; Kakihara, Shinji; Matsui, Shuhei; Shindo, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Dai, Kun; Tanaka, Megumu; Kamiyoshi, Akiko; Sakurai, Takayuki; Ichikawa-Shindo, Yuka; Kawate, Hisaka; Cui, Nanqi; Wei, Yangxuan; Shindo, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Tanaka, Masaaki; Kakihara, Shinji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Matsui, Shuhei] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Shindo, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Shindo, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tshindo@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Bristol-Myers Squibb CompanyBristol-Myers Squibb; Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology; Naito FoundationNaito Memorial Foundation; Public Foundation of Chubu Science and Technology Center; Yamaguchi Endocrine Research Foundation; Hoyu Science Foundation; Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation; Akaeda Medical Research FoundationMedical Research Council UK (MRC); Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medial Sciences; Japan Heart Foundation; Otsuka Toshimi Scholarship FoundationOtsuka Pharmaceutical,"This study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) from the Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), and research grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology, the Naito Foundation, the Public Foundation of Chubu Science and Technology Center, Yamaguchi Endocrine Research Foundation, Hoyu Science Foundation, Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation, Akaeda Medical Research Foundation, Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medial Sciences, and Japan Heart Foundation.

In a field cultivation test of Empire type (serrated leaf) and Salinas type (wavy leaf) cultivars, Empire type cultivars showed increased tipburn susceptibility and late bolting compared with Salinas type cultivars. We attempted genetic mapping of leaf shape and bolting time by ddRAD-seq using the F2 population derived from a cross between 'VI185' (Empire type) and 'ShinanoGreen' (Salinas type). These analyses suggested that both traits are controlled by a single locus in LG5. Genotyping of 51 commercial lettuce cultivars with a tightly linked marker (LG5_v8_252.743Mbp) at this locus showed an association between its genotype and the serrated leaf phenotype. By further fine mapping and transcriptome analysis, a gene encoding putative CIN-like TCP transcription factor was determined to be a candidate gene at this locus and was designated as LsTCP4. An insertion of retrotransposable element was found in the allele of 'VI185', and its transcript level in the leaves was lower than that in 'ShinanoGreen'. Because shapes of leaf epidermal cells in 'VI185' were similar to those in the TCP family mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, the leaf shape phenotype was likely caused by reduced expression of LsTCP4. Furthermore, because it is known that the TCP family protein also controls flowering time via interaction with FT in A. thaliana, it was highly possible that LsTCP4 gave pleiotropic effects on both leaf shape and bolting time in lettuce.","[Seki, Kousuke] Nagano Vegetable & Ornamental Crops Expt Stn, Tokoo 1066-1, Shiojiri, Nagano 3996461, Japan; [Komatsu, Kenji] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Bioresource Dev, Funako 1737, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430034, Japan; [Tanaka, Keisuke] Tokyo Univ Agr, NODAI Genome Res Ctr, Setagaya Ku, Sakuragaoka 1-1-1, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Hiraga, Masahiro] Nagano Fruit Tree Expt Stn, Ogawara 492, Suzaka, Nagano 3820072, Japan; [Kajiya-Kanegae, Hiromi] NARO, Res Ctr Agr Informat Technol, Kannondai 3-1-1, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058517, Japan; [Matsumura, Hideo] Shinshu Univ, Gene Res Ctr, Tsuneta 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Uno, Yuichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Agr Sci, Dept Bioresource Sci, Plant Sci Div,Nada Ku, Rokkodai 1-1, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan","Seki, K (reprint author), Nagano Vegetable & Ornamental Crops Expt Stn, Tokoo 1066-1, Shiojiri, Nagano 3996461, Japan.; Seki, K (reprint author), Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Bioresource Dev, Funako 1737, Atsugi, Kanagawa 2430034, Japan.",seki-kosuke@pref.nagano.lg.jp,,"seki, kousuke/0000-0002-5420-838X; Matsumura, Hideo/0000-0003-4849-1016","Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Project for Climate Change, Vegetable) [4103]; Cooperative Research Grant of the Genome Research for BioResource, NODAI Genome Research Center, Tokyo University of Agriculture; MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, 2013-2017 [S1311017]","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (Project for Climate Change, Vegetable-4103) for K.S., Cooperative Research Grant of the Genome Research for BioResource, NODAI Genome Research Center, Tokyo University of Agriculture for K.S. and K.K., Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research for K.K., MEXT-Supported Program for the Strategic Research Foundation at Private Universities, 2013-2017 (S1311017) for K.K.

Several theoretical advantages exist for this technique; however, clinical results remain inconsistent and controversial. We have focused on the bio mechanical function of the remnant and have been performing a new remnant-preserving reconstruction procedure that augments the graft with residual remnant. Preserving the structure and continuity of good-quality remnants may help maintain the early postoperative stress on the tendon graft, thereby providing a positive effect on remodeling. Although our concept is significantly different from previously reported remnant preservation techniques and has several pitfalls, the surgical technique that we outline in this report is simple and does not require specialized equipment. The procedure will also work more advantageously in preserving the residual mechano receptors in the remnant. We believe that this method can be a procedure with better results for patients with remnants that are in good condition.","[Tensho, Keiji; Iwaasa, Tomoya; Shimodaira, Hiroki; Koyama, Suguru; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Takahashi, Jun] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Saito, Naoto] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Inst Biomed Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Tensho, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthoped Surg, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",kten@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,8,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2212-6287,,,ARTHROSC TEC,Arthrosc.

In order to prevent such devastating complication, intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP) has been conducted. However, to prevent postoperative motor dysfunction, proper understanding of MEP monitoring and proper anesthetic managements are required. Especially, a variety of anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agent are known to attenuate MEP responses. In addition to the selection of anesthetic regime to record the baseline and control MEP, the measures to keep the level of hypnosis and muscular relaxation at constant are crucial to detect the changes of MEP responses after the surgical manipulation. Once the changes of MEP are observed based on the institutional alarm criteria, multidisciplinary team members should share the results of MEP monitoring and respond to check the status of monitoring and recover the possible motor nerve injury. Prevention of MEP-related adverse effects is also important to be considered.

In conclusion, significant differences were observed in the FDG accumulation patterns and SUVmax values of the hilar lymph nodes between IgG4-RD with BHL and sarcoidosis, although both diseases develop through the lymphatic routes of the lungs and are frequently associated with BHL.","[Ozawa, Yoko; Yamamoto, Hiroshi; Yasuo, Masanori; Komatsu, Masamichi; Ushiki, Atsuhito; Hanaoka, Masayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hamano, Hideaki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 2, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Uehara, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Lab Med, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kawakami, Satoshi; Fujita, Akira; Fujinaga, Yasunari] Shinshu Univ, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Oguchi, Kazuhiro] Aizawa Hosp, Positron Imaging Ctr, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kawa, Shigeyuki] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Dept Internal Med, Shiojiri, Nagano, Japan","Yasuo, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",yasumasa@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Ozawa, Yoko/AAH-9888-2020",,"Research Program of Intractable Disease; Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H29-Nanchi-Ippan-058]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15K09169]","This study was supported by the Research Program of Intractable Disease, the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan (No. H29-Nanchi-Ippan-058), and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (No. 15K09169).",,33,0,0,0,0,"NAGOYA UNIV, SCH MED",NAGOYA,"EDITORIAL OFF, NAGOYA UNIV MED LIB, SCH MED, 65 TSURUMAI-CHO SHOWA- KU, NAGOYA, 466-8550, JAPAN",2186-3326,0027-7622,,NAGOYA J MED SCI,Nagoya J.

We conducted experiments that involved electrospinning a natural extract in a polymer solution to fuse the extracts in polymer nanofibers. The Juniperus chinensis extracts (JCE) were mixed with a polyurethane (PU) solution to make a nanofiber web (PU/JCE), which was laminated with polyethylene terephthalate at 90, 110, and 130 degrees C (PU/JCE-LC). We analyzed the morphology, air permeability, water vapor transmission, resistance to water penetration, contact coldness (Q(max)), and antibacterial properties of the fabricated PU/JCE nanofiber laminate composites. It was found that as the laminating temperature increased, the air and moisture permeability of the PU/JCE nanofiber laminate decreased, and its water resistance and Q(max) increased. Also, the antibacterial test confirmed that the laminate provided antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The results reveal that the combination process of electrospinning and laminating can provide an effective way to assign functionalities of natural extracts, which opens up the possibility of imparting a variety of functionalities from nature into polymeric nanofiber.","[Kim, Jeong-hwa; Lee, Jung-soon] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Clothing & Text, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Hoik] Korea Inst Ind Technol, 143 Hanggaul Ro, Ansan, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Lee, JS (reprint author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Clothing & Text, Daejeon, South Korea.; Kim, IS (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",jungsoon@cnu.ac.kr; kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korea Government [NRF-2017R1A2B4009315]","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korea Government (NRF-2017R1A2B4009315).",,31,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0170-0839,1436-2449,,POLYM BULL,Polym.

To make this possible, a next-generation networked operating room, ""Smart Cyber Operating Theater"" (SCOT), has been developed with medical-engineer cooperation. SCOT integrates stand-alone medical devices using the ""OPeLiNK"" communication interface. Using OPeLiNK, medical devices are connected and various data, such as intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging, neuromonitoring, biochemical monitoring, and navigation system, are integrated and displayed in the same timeline. CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors succeeded in clinical tumor resection via the endoscopic endonasal approach using the SCOT system in a 79-year-old man with a large nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. The surgeons performed the operation while sharing information in real time between all staff in the operating room and supervising expert surgeons at the surgical strategy desk. Any decisions, such as intraoperative surgical procedures, were made with discussion between the operating room and the surgical strategy desk. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case report of endoscopic endonasal approach performed successfully in the SCOT. Further developments in this technology may lead to innovations in not only microscopic neurosurgery but also endoscopic neurosurgery.","[Nakamura, Takuya; Ogiwara, Toshihiro; Goto, Tetsuya; Fujii, Yu; Miyaoka, Yoshinari; Hanaoka, Yoshiki; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Ogiwara, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",togiwara@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,6,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1878-8750,1878-8769,,WORLD NEUROSURG,World Neurosurg.,FEB,2020,134,,,,,,293,296,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.11.021,,,4,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,KK6VS,WOS:000512878200184,31715411,,,,2020/4/20

Here, we evaluated the analytical performance of a new IgG4 assay reagent featuring a wide dynamic range, highly specific monoclonal antibody, and the reversed passive latex agglutination assay and determined the IgG4 reference interval (RI) for the Japanese population. Methods: Performance evaluations were conducted on precision, linearity, sensitivity, interference, and method comparison with The Binding Site (TBS) and Siemens reagents. The RI was derived by the parametric method from 619 apparently healthy Japanese 18 to 65 years of age. Results: Between-day precisions ranged from 1.99 to 5.52 CV%. Linearity was confirmed up to 5.0 g/l. The limit of quantitation was 0.085 g/l. Interfering substances did not significantly influence values. Method comparison among the 3 reagents yielded correlation coefficients between 0.973 and 0.988. Values for the new reagent matched those of TBS reagent except at a higher concentration range, where reactivity dissociated. The RI was 0.11-1.21 g/l without distinction by sex and age. Conclusion: The novel IgG4 assay reagent demonstrated satisfactory analytical performance for clinical use. Because of matched value with TBS reagent at low concentrations, it is possible to use the IgG4-RD cut-off value determined by TBS reagent.","[Usami, Yoko; Uehara, Takeshi; Sugano, Mitsutoshi; Ishimine, Nau; Honda, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Lab Med, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Ichihara, Kiyoshi] Yamaguchi Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Clin Lab Sci, Grad Sch Med, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan; [Kawasaki, Kenji] Chiba Univ, Div Lab Med, Sch Med, Chiba, Japan; [Yamauchi, Kazuyoshi] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Med, Dept Lab Med, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hamano, Hideaki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Uehara, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Lab Med, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tuehara@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Nittobo Medical Co., Ltd.","We are grateful to Nittobo Medical Co., Ltd. for the generous support of reagents and consumables required for carrying out this study.",,15,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0009-8981,1873-3492,,CLIN CHIM ACTA,Clin.

She experienced massive hematochezia and anal pain at the age of 52 years and was transferred to our hospital. Endoscopic examination revealed a deep rectal ulcer with arterial bleeding. A stoma constructed at the transverse colon for refractory CD relieved her symptoms. Four months later, computed tomography showed increased thickness of the rectal wall. DLBCL was diagnosed from biopsy specimens of the rectum. Treatment with 6 courses of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone along with additional radiation therapy for remnant rectal lymphoma has resulted in complete remission for over 5 years.

After excluding viral hepatitis, alcohol or drug-induced liver injury, and autoimmune liver diseases, liver histology evidence of macrovesicular steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, and pericellular fibrosis confirmed a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Luseogliflozin (2.5 mg/day), a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2I), was co-administered to strengthen glycemic control. Liver enzymes and HbA1c gradually improved without any adverse events. A second liver biopsy at 15 months after luseogliflozin commencement revealed improvements in steatosis, fibrosis, and overall histological activity score.

Despite having a temperature profile of a warm temperate zone, Mikura-jima has many plant species representative of a cool temperature zone. Temperature environment is an essential parameter for determining the development of vegetation and flora, but little data are available for the island. In the present study, we measured atmospheric temperature by thermographs at seven different elevations (130, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 m) over a period of 5 years (from 2013 to 2017), and we determined the warm index, cool index and rate of decline with elevation.

Warm index (W.I.) was estimated to fall below 85 at elevations over about 800 m, which allows the existence of a cool temperature zone.

Cough peak flow (CPF) is an objective indicator of cough strength, and CPF evaluation might be useful to assess whether food intake can be restarted. We aimed to examine whether cough strength assessed with CPF can be used as an indicator of the aspiration risk when restarting food intake in elderly subjects with CAP. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 82 elderly subjects with CAP between August 2016 and March 2018. CPF was measured using a peak flow meter, and we performed the repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), which is a videoendoscopic evaluation of swallowing and is used to assess dysphagia and aspiration. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. The cutoff value was determined, and the area under the ROC was calculated. RESULTS: The areas under the RSST and CPF curves were 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. The RSST value for identifying the aspiration risk was 2.5 swallows. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were 70.0%, 71.7%, 2.5, and 0.42, respectively. The CPF for identifying the aspiration risk was 190 L/min. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio were 82.6%, 69.4%, 2.7, and 0.25, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that cough strength assessed with CPF can be used as an indicator of the aspiration risk when restarting food intake in elderly subjects with CAP and that CPF evaluation is not inferior to the RSST. However, CPF evaluation should be performed together with swallowing screening tests to determine the aspiration risk.","[Sakai, Yasunari] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Rehabil, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Ohira, Masayoshi; Yokokawa, Yoshiharu] Shinshu Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Phys Therapy, Matusmoto, Japan","Sakai, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Rehabil, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",yasunari_sakai1028@yahoo.co.jp,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,DAEDALUS ENTERPRISES INC,IRVING,"9425 N MAC ARTHUR BLVD, STE 100, IRVING, TX 75063-4706 USA",0020-1324,1943-3654,,RESP CARE,Respir.

Recently, Ahr(-/-) mice were revealed to develop cecal tumors with inflammation and Wnt/beta-catenin pathway activation. However, whether beta-catenin degradation is AhR dependent remains unclear. To determine whether other signaling pathways function in Ahr(-/-) cecal tumorigenesis, we investigated histologic characteristics of the tumors and cytokine/chemokine production in tumors and Ahr(-/-) peritoneal macrophages. AhR expression was also assessed in human colorectal carcinomas. Of the 28 Ahr(-/-) mice, 10 developed cecal Lesions by 50 weeks of age, an incidence significantly lower than previously reported. Cecal lesions of Ahr(-/-) mice developed from serrated hyperplasia to adenoma/dysplasia-like neoplasia with enhanced proliferation. Macrophage and neutrophil infiltration into the lesions was also observed early in serrated hyperplasia, although adjacent mucosa was devoid of inflammation. Il1b, Il6, Ccl2, and Cxcl5 were up-regulated at lesion sites, whereas only IL-6 production increased in Ahr(-/-) peritoneal macrophages after lipopolysaccharide + ATP stimulation. Neither Myc (alias c-myc) up-regulation nor beta-catenin nuclear translocation was observed, unlike previously reported. Interestingly, enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Src, and epidermal growth factor receptor and Amphiregulin up-regulation at Ahr(-/-) lesion sites were detected. In human serrated lesions, however, AhR expression in epithelial cells was up-regulated despite morphologic similarity to Ahr(-/-) cecal lesions. Our results suggest novel mechanisms underlying Ahr(-/-) cecal tumorigenesis, depending primarily on cecum-specific mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activation and inflammation.","[Matoba, Hisanori; Fujii, Chifumi; Kawakubo, Masatomo; Nakayama, Jun] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Pathol, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Takamoto, Masaya] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Infect & Host Def & Pathobiol, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Taniguchi, Shun'ichiro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Comprehens Canc Therapy, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Matoba, Hisanori; Misawa, Ken] Ina Cent Hosp, Dept Pathol, Ina, Saitama, Japan; [Fujii, Chifumi] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Biotechnol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kasuga, Eriko; Natori, Tatsuya] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Matsumura, Tomio] Anaeropharma Sci Inc, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Fujii, C (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Pathol, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Takamoto, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Infect & Host Def & Pathobiol, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",masaya@shinshu-u.ac.jp; chifumif@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medical Sciences grant; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP18K08613, JP15H04712, 19H03441]","Supported in part by Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medical Sciences grant (H.M.); and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science grants-in-aid for scientific research (C) JP18K08613 (C.F.), (B) JP15H04712 (J.N.), and 19H03441 (J.N.).",,52,0,0,2,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0002-9440,1525-2191,,AM J PATHOL,Am.

Methods CSF1R testing was conducted on 145 consecutive leukoencephalopathy cases who were clinically suspected of having adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia. From these, 135 cases whose detailed clinical information was available were enrolled. Forward logistic stepwise regression was performed to generate a probability model to predict a positive CSF1R mutation result. The current diagnostic criteria were also applied to our cohort and their sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Results Twenty-eight CSF1R-mutation-positive cases and 107 CSF1R-mutation-negative cases were identified. Our probability model suggested that factors raising the probability of a CSF1R-mutation-positive result were younger onset, parkinsonism, thinning of the corpus callosum and diffusion-restricted lesions. It also showed that involuntary movements and brainstem or cerebellar atrophy were negative predictors of a CSF1R-mutation-positive result. In our cohort, the sensitivity and specificity for 'probable' or 'possible' CSF1R-related leukoencephalopathy were 81% and 14%, respectively. Conclusions Clinical and brain imaging features predictive of the presence of a CSF1R mutation are proposed. Consideration of these factors will help prioritize patients for CSF1R testing.","[Kondo, Y.; Nagasaki, S.; Nakamura, K.; Sekijima, Y.] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Neurol & Rheumatol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kondo, Y.] Nagano Municipal Hosp, Dept Neurol, Nagano, Japan; [Matsushima, A.] Kakeyu Hosp, JA Nagano Koseiren Kakeyu Misayama Rehabil Ctr, Dept Neurol, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Nakamura, K.] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Ctr Med Genet, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yoshida, K.] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Brain Dis Res, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3900861, Japan","Yoshida, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Brain Dis Res, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3900861, Japan.",kyoshida@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"The Research Committee for Hereditary Cerebral Small Vessel Disease and Associated Disorders, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan",,,13,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-5101,1468-1331,,EUR J NEUROL,Eur.

Many different factors affect and determine plant salt tolerance. Nonetheless, there is a consensus on the relevance of maintaining an optimal cytosolic potassium : sodium ion (K+ : Na+) ratio for salinity tolerance in plants. This ratio depends on the operation of plasma membrane and tonoplast transporters. In the present review we focus on some aspects related to the energetic cost of maintaining that K+ : Na+ ratio. One of the factors that affect the cost of the first step of K+ acquisition - root K+ uptake through High Affinity K+ transporter and Arabidopsis K+ transport system 1 transport systems - is the value of the plasma membrane potential of root cells, a parameter that may differ amongst plant species. In addition to its role in nutrition, cytosolic K+ also is important for signalling, and K+ efflux through gated outward-rectifying K+ and nonselective cation channels can be regarded as a switch to redirect energy towards defence reactions. In maintaining cytosolic K+, the great buffer capacity of the vacuole should be considered. The possible role of high-affinity K+ transporters (HKT)2s in mediating K+ uptake under saline conditions and the importance of cycling of K+ throughout the plant also are discussed.","[Rubio, Francisco; Nieves-Cordones, Manuel] CSIC, CEBAS, Plant Nutr Dept, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain; [Horie, Tomoaki] Shinshu Univ, Div Appl Biol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 388567, Japan; [Shabala, Sergey] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia; [Shabala, Sergey] Foshan Univ, Int Ctr Environm Membrane Biol, Foshan 528041, Peoples R China","Rubio, F (reprint author), CSIC, CEBAS, Plant Nutr Dept, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.; Shabala, S (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Inst Agr, Hobart, Tas 7005, Australia.; Shabala, S (reprint author), Foshan Univ, Int Ctr Environm Membrane Biol, Foshan 528041, Peoples R China.",frubio@cebas.csic.es; Sergey.Shabala@utas.edu.au,"Shabala, Sergey/AAF-5449-2020; Rubio, Francisco/K-2854-2014","Shabala, Sergey/0000-0003-2345-8981; Rubio, Francisco/0000-0001-7640-9548; Nieves-Cordones, Manuel/0000-0002-4015-0981",,,,74,6,6,7,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0028-646X,1469-8137,,NEW PHYTOL,New Phytol.,FEB,2020,225,3,,,SI,,1097,1104,,10.1111/nph.15852,,,8,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,KA0PE,WOS:000505502200008,30993727,Other Gold,,,2020/4/20

Average bundle size of the SWCNT cryogels is 30% smaller than that of pristine SWCNTs according to the TEM observation. Adsorption isotherms of N-2 at 77 K and Ar at 87 K for SWCNT cryogels and pristine SWCNTs have explicit adsorption hysteresis in low and high relative pressure regions, indicating the presence of necked ultramicropores and mesopores. Ar adsorption isotherms show that the SWCNT cryogels have predominant low and high relative pressure hysteresis, suggesting the presence of mesopores with necked entrances of ultramicropores.

In this paper, a polyamide RO membrane was modified with a polyampholyte composed of anionic 2-carboxyethyl acrylate (CAA) and cationic [2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethyl ammonium chloride (TMA) by surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization, in order to improve its anti-biofouling properties. The anti-biofouling properties of membranes with different CAA/TMA surface ratios were evaluated by protein adsorption, static bacterial attachment, and long-term dynamic biofouling filtration experiments. It was found that an electrostatic attraction resulted in a severe biofouling, even if the water contact angle was 5-20 degrees and the membrane hydrophilicity was sufficiently high. However, the RO membrane with CAA/TMA surface ratio of 1:1, fabricated from a mixed monomer solution with 3:1 CAA/TMA ratio showed an excellent anti-biofouling performance even in long-term dynamic biofouling filtration experiments. These good anti-biofouling properties derive from the high hydrophilicity of the membrane surface, resulting from its large content of ionic groups, and the almost complete lack of electrostatic attractions with charged bacteria, because the net surface charge is close to zero.","[Yang, Zhe; Takagi, Ryosuke; Matsuyama, Hideto] Kobe Univ, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Res Ctr Membrane & Film Technol, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Saeki, Daisuke] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Matsuyama, H (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Res Ctr Membrane & Film Technol, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",matuyama@kobe-u.ac.jp,"Matsuyama, Hideto/G-2357-2016","Matsuyama, Hideto/0000-0003-2468-4905",,,,64,0,0,38,38,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0376-7388,1873-3123,,J MEMBRANE SCI,J.

Although these reproductive barriers have been observed in many plant species, the underlying mechanisms remain to be comprehensively elucidated. In this study, we detected a hybridization barrier between apple (Malus x domestica) and pear (Pyrus spp.) belonging to different genera in the subtribe Malinae of the family Rosaceae. Pollination experiments revealed that Pyrus pyrifolia (Japanese pear) pollen is compatible with Malus pistils, whereas Pyrus communis (European pear) pollen is not. These results imply there is a distinct cross-(in)compatibility reaction occurring in Pyrus species. Based on the varying pollen tube behaviors among Pyrus species, genetic analysis was conducted to identify the genomic region responsible for the intergeneric barrier. Malus-Pyrus intergeneric hybrids were used to detect distorted segregation regions by combining genome sequencing and fine-scale genotyping data. We defined a single locus on chromosome 5, in which P. pyrifolia-derived alleles were exclusively inherited to the intergeneric hybrids from the Pyrus interspecific hybrid. Of the 235 genes in this genomic region, 80 exhibited a specific pollen-expression pattern, including genes involved in self-incompatibility reactions.

The ecology of this species has emerged from studies of the genetic background of mycelial colonies in nature. Single putative colonies sometimes comprise several genets. This complex mycelial structure should be subjected to analysis to determine its ecophysiological significance. We tested the ectomycorrhization ability of nine T. matsutake sibling spore isolates. The ectomycorrhizal colonization ratio differed significantly among isolates, and was dependent on the soil nitrogen content. Mixed inoculations of three selected isolates into soils in which single pine seedlings were grown showed that the isolates interacted in the seedling roots. Paired inoculations of isolates #52/#99 and #52/#84, and a triple inoculation of isolates #52/#84/#99 resulted in levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization that significantly exceeded the colonization levels following single isolate inoculation. We suggest that mycelial interaction between sibling isolates is a significant phenomenon that operates within individual ectomycorrhizal pine root tips.

Currently, MPs are collected predominantly by sieving and filtration, which is the rate-determining process in contemporary MP research. This study experimentally and theoretically verified the applicability of acoustic focusing for the collection of MPs. As model MPs, polystyrene microparticles and small fibers of Nylon 6 and polyethylene terephthalate were examined. To generate a standing acoustic wave, piezo elements were attached to a microfluidic device, in which the microchannel is trifurcated. A suspension of the microparticles was introduced into the microchannel and focused on its center using an acoustophoretic force, which allowed collecting almost all microparticles from the middle channel of the trifurcated branches. A theoretical examination based on the focusing time of the microparticles indicated that the device should be able to collect MPs of approximately 5 mu m in diameter. Similar to the microparticles, the majority of both types of fibers were collected from the middle channel. However, it should be noted that some fibers were attached to the wall of the microchannel and remained therein due to gravitational sinking. Both the experimental results and the theoretical estimations suggest promising potential for acoustic focusing as a means to remove MPs from aqueous suspensions such as the effluent from laundry machines.","[Akiyama, Yoshitake; Egawa, Takatoshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Koyano, Kiyoshi] Izumi Giken Co Ltd, 988-1 Mochizuki, Saku, Nagano 3842202, Japan; [Moriwaki, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Akiyama, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Moriwaki, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Appl Biol, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",aki@shinshu-u.ac.jp; moriwaki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [17H03202]","The work was partially funded by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (17H03202) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT).

The objectives of the present study were to examine the association between visceral fat accumulation and prevalence of mild cognitive impairment and its subtypes. Design: a cross-sectional study. Participants This study enrolled 6,109 community-dwelling older adults, including 3,434 women (mean age: 74.4 years) and 2,675 men (mean age: 74.3 years). Individuals with dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke, Mini-Mental State Examination scores <= 23, and who could not perform basic activities of daily living independently were excluded. Measurements Participants underwent neurocognitive assessments to assess mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its subtypes. Visceral fat area (VFA) was measured using abdominal bioelectrical impedance analysis. Participants were divided into quartile groups by VFA. Results There were 731 (21.3%) women and 562 (21.0%) men with MCI, and the median VFA values were 63.3 cm2 and 96.3 cm2, respectively. Women participants in the second (adjusted odds ratios [aOR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.54-0.94), third (aOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.47-0.92), and fourth quartiles of VFA (aOR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.93) had a significantly lower risk of MCI than those in the first quartile. Higher VFA quartiles in women were associated with lower risk of non-amnestic MCI. There were no significant differences in men between quartiles. Conclusions Visceral fat accumulation was associated with MCI, especially non-amnestic MCI, in community-dwelling older Japanese women. These results suggest that visceral fat accumulation is partially protective against cognitive impairment.","[Chiba, I; Lee, S.; Bae, S.; Makino, K.; Shinkai, Y.; Shimada, H.] Natl Ctr Geriatr & Gerontol, Dept Prevent Gerontol, Ctr Gerontol & Social Sci, Obu, Japan; [Chiba, I; Shimada, H.] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Sci, Med Sci Div, Graduated Sch Med Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Chiba, I (reprint author), 7-430 Morioka Cho, Obu City, Aichi 4748511, Japan.",ichiba@nogg.go.jp,,,"National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology (NCGG) [27-22]; Kao Corporation [26242059]; Strategic Basic Research Programs Redesigning Communities for Aged Society (RISTEX) of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Health and Labor Sciences Research GrantsMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan","The work in Takahama city was supported by a Research Funding for Longevity Sciences (27-22) from the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology (NCGG), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (26242059), joint research with Kao Corporation, and expenses for R&D were commissioned by Takahama city.

A TaN thin film is first deposited on a Ta substrate by the Ar/N-2 ion sputtering of a Ta target, and then covered with a TaOx layer by Ar/O-2 sputtering. The TaOx layer is subsequently nitrided in an NH3 flow to a Ta3N5 layer. Finally, Ba metal is deposited on the Ta3N5/TaN/Ta substrate under vacuum, oxidized, and carbonized to produce BaCO3. The interfacial reaction between the BaCO3 and Ta3N5 layers is conducted in a N-2 atmosphere at high temperatures. X-ray diffraction patterns confirm BaTaO2N and Ta2N phases on the Ta substrates, while cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images show a three-layer BaTaO2N/Ta2N/Ta structure. Cobalt oxide (CoOx)-deposited BaTaO2N/Ta2N/Ta photoanodes for water oxidation provide a high photocurrent of 4.6 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V (vs RHE) and an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency of 9% at 600 nm under simulated AM1.5G irradiation. The efficiency of this photoanode is remarkably improved compared with previously reported photoanode thin films. Interestingly, a BaTaO2N/Ta2N/Ta electrode with similar photoanode performance is also obtained via the interfacial reaction between TaN and BaCO3 layers.","[Nishimae, Shinji; Inoue, Yasunobu] Japan Technol Res Assoc Artificial Photosynthet C, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Mishima, Yuji] Kobe Mat Testing Lab Co Ltd, Hyogo Ku, 3-2-24 Wadamiya Dori, Kobe, Hyogo 6520863, Japan; [Nishiyama, Hiroshi; Sasaki, Yutaka; Katayama, Masao; Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Nakabayashi, Mamiko] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Sch Engn, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, RISM, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Domen, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Sch Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.; Domen, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, RISM, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",domen@chemsys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Domen, Kazunari/0000-0001-7995-4832",Japan Technological Research Association as part of the Artificial Photosynthetic Chemical Process (ARPChem) of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO),This work was financially supported by the Japan Technological Research Association as part of the Artificial Photosynthetic Chemical Process (ARPChem) of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

An International Multi-center Study,ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY,,,English,Article; Early Access,,,,,,,PORTAL-VEIN LIGATION; ASSOCIATING LIVER PARTITION; STAGED HEPATECTOMY ALPPS; HEPATOBILIARY SCINTIGRAPHY; HEPATIC RESECTION; REMNANT LIVER; SURVIVAL; VOLUME; RECURRENCE; GUIDELINES,"Background ALPPS is found to increase the resectability of primary and secondary liver malignancy at the advanced stage. The aim of the study was to verify the surgical and oncological outcome of ALPPS for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Methods The study cohort was based on the ALPPS registry with patients from 31 international centers between August 2009 and January 2018. Propensity score matched patients receiving chemotherapy only were selected from the SEER database as controls for the survival analysis. Results One hundred and two patients undergoing ALPPS were recruited, 99 completed the second stage with median inter-stage duration of 11 days. The median kinetic growth rate was 23 ml/day. R0 resection was achieved in 87 (85%). Initially high rates of morbidity and mortality decreased steadily to a 29% severe complication rate and 7% 90-day morbidity in the last 2 years. Post-hepatectomy liver failure remained the main cause of 90-day mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed insufficient future liver remnant at the stage-2 operation (FLR2) to be the only risk factor for severe complications (OR 2.91, p = 0.02). The propensity score matching analysis showed a superior overall survival in the ALPPS group compared to palliative chemotherapy (median overall survival: 26.4 months vs 14 months; 1-, 2-, and 3-year survival rates: 82.4%, 70.5% and 39.6% vs 51.2%, 21.4% and 11.3%, respectively, p < 0.01). The survival benefit, however, was not confirmed in the subgroup analysis for patients with insufficient FLR2 or multifocal ICC. Conclusion ALPPS showed high efficacy in achieving R0 resections in locally advanced ICC. To get the most oncological benefit from this aggressive surgery, ALPPS would be restricted to patients with single lesions and sufficient FLR2.","[Li, Jun; Heumann, Asmus; Stueben, Bjoern-Ole; Izbicki, Jakob R.] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Gen Visceral & Thorac Surg, Hamburg, Germany; [Moustafa, Mohamed; Gringeri, Enrico; Fasolo, Elisa; Cillo, Umberto] Univ Padua, Hepatobiliary Surg & Liver Transplant Unit, Padua, Italy; [Linecker, Michael; Clavien, Pierre-Alain; Petrowsky, Henrik] Univ Hosp Zurich, Swiss HPB & Transplantat Ctr, Dept Surg & Transplantat, Zurich, Switzerland; [Lurje, Georg; Bednarsch, Jan; Neumann, Ulf] Univ Hosp RWTH Aachen, Dept Surg & Transplantat, Aachen, Germany; [Capobianco, Ivan; Rolinger, Jens; Nadalin, Silvio] Univ Hosp Tuebingen, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplantat Surg, Tubingen, Germany; [Baumgart, Janine; Lang, Hauke] Univ Hosp Mainz, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplantat Surg, Mainz, Germany; [Ratti, Francesca; Aldrighetti, Luca] Osped San Raffaele, Hepatobiliary Surg Div, Milan, Italy; [Rauchfuss, Falk; Settmacher, Utz] Univ Hosp Jena, Dept Gen Visceral & Vasc Surg, Jena, Germany; [Balci, Deniz] Ankara Univ, Dept Surg, Ankara, Turkey; [Fernandes, Eduardo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Dept Surg, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Fernandes, Eduardo] Sao Lucas Hosp Copacabana, Dept Surg & Transplantat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Montalti, Roberto] Federico II Univ Hosp, Dept Publ Hlth, Naples, Italy; [Robles-Campos, Ricardo] Virgen Arrixaca Hosp, Dept Surg, IMIB Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain; [Bjornsson, Bergthor] Linkoping Univ, Dept Surg, Linkoping, Sweden; [Bjornsson, Bergthor] Linkoping Univ, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Linkoping, Sweden; [Topp, Stefan A.] Univ Hosp Dusseldorf, Dept Gen Visceral & Pediat Surg, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Fronek, Jiri; Kristek, Jakub] Inst Clin & Expt Med, Dept Transplant Surg, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fronek, Jiri; Kristek, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Med 2, Dept Anat, Prague, Czech Republic; [Liu, Chao] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sun Yat Sen Mem Hosp, Dept Hepatopancreatobiliary Surg, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Wahba, Roger; Bruns, Christiane] Univ Hosp Cologne, Dept Gen Visceral Canc & Transplantat Surg, Cologne, Germany; [Brunner, Stefan M.; Schlitt, Hans J.] Univ Med Ctr Regensburg, Dept Surg, Regensburg, Germany; [Hernandez-Alejandro, Roberto] Univ Rochester, Div Transplantat & Hepatobiliary Surg, Rochester, NY USA; [Schnitzbauer, Andreas] Univ Hosp Frankfurt, Dept Gen Visceral & Transplantat Surg, Frankfurt, Germany; [Nuessler, Natascha] Munchen Klin Neuperlach, Dept Gen Visceral & Endocrine Surg, Munich, Germany; [Schoen, Michael R.] Klinikum Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Voskanyan, Sergey] AI Burnazyan Russian State Sci Ctr FMBC FMBA, Ctr Surg & Transplantol, Moscow, Russia; [Petrou, Athanasios S.] Nicosia Teaching Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, Strovolos, Cyprus; [Hahn, Oszkar] Semmelweis Univ, Dept Surg 1, Budapest, Hungary; [Soejima, Yuji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Surg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Vicente, Emilio] San Pablo Univ CEU, Sanchinarro Univ Hosp, Clara Campal Oncol Ctr, Madrid, Spain; [Castro-Benitez, Carlos; Adam, Rene] Univ Paris Saclay, Hop Paul Brousse, AP HP, Ctr Hepatobiliaire,Inserm 935, F-935 Villejuif, France; [Tomassini, Federico; Troisi, Roberto Ivan] Univ Ghent, Fac Med, Dept Human Struct & Repair, Ghent, Belgium; [Troisi, Roberto Ivan] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Clin Med & Surg, Naples, Italy; [Kantas, Alexandros; Oldhafer, Karl Juergen] Semmelweis Univ Budapest, Asklepios Hosp Barmbek, Dept Surg, Div HPB Surg, Campus Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany; [Ardiles, Victoria; de Santibanes, Eduardo] Italian Hosp Buenos Aires, HPB Surg & Liver Transplant Unit, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Malago, Massimo] UCL, Dept Surg, London, England; [Vivarelli, Marco] Polytech Univ Marche, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Hepatobiliary & Abdominal Transplantat Surg, Ancona, Italy","Li, J (reprint author), Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Gen Visceral & Thorac Surg, Hamburg, Germany.",j.li@uke.de,"Linecker, Michael/W-5965-2019; Kristek, Jakub/W-5727-2019","Linecker, Michael/0000-0002-0721-6811; Kristek, Jakub/0000-0002-3758-2273; CASTRO-BENITEZ, Carlos/0000-0001-5040-5960; Li, Jun/0000-0003-1553-8105; Moustafa, Mohamed/0000-0001-9912-0878",,,,49,1,1,1,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1068-9265,1534-4681,,ANN SURG ONCOL,Ann.

The hemiporphyrazine ring was opened and one additional pyridine unit was introduced, resulting in an overlap of two pyridine rings. X-ray structure analysis confirmed that 1(2H) and its zinc complex (1(Zn)) adopt a helical geometry. A racemic mixture of 1(Zn) was resolved into two enantiomers ((P)- and (M)-1(Zn)), which exhibited CPL with a high luminescence dissymmetry factor (g(lum)) value of +/- 2.1x10(-2). The origin of the large g(lum) value was rationalized by means of DFT calculations. Helical structures could be formed in a diastereoselective manner by covalently attaching chiral units to the skeleton (1'(2H) and 1'(Zn)). 1(Zn) was found to possess chiral recognition ability for amines.","[Tanaka, Yusuke; Murayama, Tomotaka; Uchiyama, Masanobu] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Muranaka, Atsuya; Imai, Eiyu; Uchiyama, Masanobu] RIKEN, CPR, Adv Elements Chem Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan; [Uchiyama, Masanobu] Shinshu Univ, RISM, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Uchiyama, M (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.; Muranaka, A; Uchiyama, M (reprint author), RIKEN, CPR, Adv Elements Chem Lab, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 3510198, Japan.; Uchiyama, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, RISM, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",atsuya-muranaka@riken.jp; uchiyama@mol.f.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Muranaka, Atsuya/0000-0002-3246-6003","JSPS KAKENHI(S)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17H06173]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17H05430]",This work was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI(S) (No. 17H06173) and JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (No. 17H05430) (to M.U.).

However, the detailed mechanisms of immunomodulation by CR remain unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model for CR and analyzed the changes of immune cells in these mice. The CR mice fed a calorie-restricted diet for 4 weeks had lower body weight and fat mass compared with control mice. The proportions of CD4(+), CD8(+), and naive CD4(+) T cells in spleen cells from CR mice were higher than those in of control mice. Additionally, the proportion of CD8(+) T cells was significantly decreased and the mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the colon of CR mice was significantly decreased compared with those of control mice. To determine the effect of CR on microRNA (miRNA) expression, serum and tissues were collected from mice and the expression level of miRNA was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. As a result, the expressions of miR-16-5p, miR-196b-5p, and miR-218-5p in serum from CR mice were higher than those in control mice. The expression of miR-16-5p increased in the spleen, thymus, colon, and stomach of CR mice compared with expression in control mice. Furthermore, RAW264 cells transfected with a miR-16-5p mimic significantly decreased the mRNA expression of IL-1D, IL-6, and TNF-alpha under LPS stimulation. These results suggested that miR-16-5p might be a critical factor involving the anti-inflammatory effects of calorie-restricted feeding.","[Yamada, Kazuki; Takizawa, Seiya; Ohgaku, Yuki; Asami, Takuya; Furuya, Kanon; Yamamoto, Kana; Takahashi, Fuka; Hamajima, Chisato; Inaba, Chihiro; Endo, Katsunori; Matsui, Rina; Tanaka, Sachi] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Kitamura, Hidemitsu] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Genet Med, Sect Dis Control, Div Funct Immunol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0900815, Japan","Tanaka, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",tanakasa@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26750039]; Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology; Japan Science Society; Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation; Institute for Genetic Medicine of Hokkaido University","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (No. 26750039) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, grants from The Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology, a Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society, the Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation, and the Joint Research Program of the Institute for Genetic Medicine of Hokkaido University.",,35,2,2,24,24,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0378-1119,1879-0038,,GENE,Gene,30-Jan,2020,725,,,,,,,,UNSP 144191,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144191,,,8,Genetics & Heredity,Genetics & Heredity,JQ2BG,WOS:000498755900005,31654705,,,,2020/4/20

There is, however, the critical issue concerning the significantly low Li-ion diffusion in an electrolyte solution, which is directly linked to the degradation of their rapid charge-discharge properties. Ionic liquids with ether-substituted cation have generated much interest as electrolyte solvents for Li-ion batteries because the ether group functions to reduce the coordination number and increase ionic conductivity. In the present study, we synthesized six types of ionic liquids consisting of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (TFSA) anions and piperidinium-based cations in which the attached side chains are 1-((2-methoxyethoxy)methyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (PP1MEM), 1-butoxymethyl-1-methylpiperidinium (PP1BM), 1-methyl-(2-propoxyethyl)piperidinium (PP1PE), 1-(3-ethoxypropyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (PP1EP), 1-(4-methoxybutyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (PP1MB), and 1-hexyl-1-methylpiperidinium (PP16). It was found that the ionic liquid with PP1MEM cations with two oxygen atoms in the side chain exhibited the lowest solvation number of TFSA anions (1.56), whereas PP1BM (1.78), PP1PE (1.86), PP1EP (2.08), and PP1MB-TFSA (2.07) resulted in a larger number, as the oxygen atoms in the alkyl side chain are located far from the positively charged nitrogen atoms. PP1MEM-TFSA with small solvation numbers enhanced the ionic conductivity and thereby achieved high electrode performance. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

In addition to porous hydrogels, nanofibers that can simulate the extracellular matrix structure for cell adhesion would be beneficial. Graphite and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) are two bioactive materials that have been used to improve cell adhesion in scaffolds for corneal tissue engineering. In this study, nanofibers were fabricated from hydroxyethyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and cross-linked by glutaraldehyde bound to graphite and nano-hydroxyapatite. This scaffold surrounded a transparent hydrogel core from PVA that was cross-linked by freeze-thawing cycles. The chemical and mechanical evaluations demonstrated that nanofibers met the requirements as a scaffold for corneal tissue engineering. The results showed that when the concentration of nHA was approximately 1.66 wt%, the morphology of human epithelial cells did not change, and clot formation occurred around the scaffold during the 1-week in vivo implantation.

We show that the partition function of JT gravity is written as the expectation value of a macroscopic loop operator in the old matrix model of 2d gravity in the background where infinitely many couplings are turned on in a specific way. Based on this expression we develop a very efficient method of computing the partition function in the genus expansion as well as in the low temperature expansion by making use of the Korteweg-de Vries constraints obeyed by the partition function. We have computed both these expansions up to very high orders using this method. It turns out that we can take a low temperature limit with the ratio of the temperature and the genus counting parameter held fixed. We find the first few orders of the expansion of the free energy in a closed form in this scaling limit. We also study numerically the behavior of the eigenvalue density and the Baker-Akhiezer function using the results in the scaling limit.","[Okuyama, Kazumi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Phys, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sakai, Kazuhiro] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Inst Phys, Totsuka Ku, 1518 Kamikurata Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2448539, Japan","Okuyama, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Phys, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",kazumi@azusa.shinshu-u.ac.jp; kzhrsakai@gmail.com,,,"JSPS KAKENHI GrantMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26400257, 16K05316, 19K03845, 19K03856]; JSPS JapanRussia Research Cooperative ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We would like to thank Peter Zograf for sharing his data of Vg;1 (b) up to g = 20.

It is often associated with systemic conditions, including autoimmune deficiencies. However, little is known about how the genetic and immunologic background of patients influences the disease. Here, we focus on human leukocyte antigen (HLA), killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), and their specific combinations that have been difficult to analyze owing to their high diversity. We employed a recently developed technology of simultaneous typing of HLA alleles and KIR haplotype and investigated alleles of the 35 HLA loci and KIR haplotypes composed of centromeric and telomeric motifs in 18 cases and 18 controls for discovery and 472 independent controls for validation. We identified an amino acid substitution of threonine at position 94 of HLA-C in combination with the telomeric KIR genotype of haplotype tA01/tB01 that had significantly higher frequency (>20%) in the case population than in both control populations. Multiple logistic regression analysis based on a dominant model with adjustments for age and sex revealed and validated its statistical significance and high predictive accuracy (C-statistic >= 0.85). Structure-based analysis revealed that the combination of the amino acid change in HLA-C and the telomeric genotype tA01/tB01 could be associated with lower stability of HLA-C. This is the first case-control study of a rare disease that employed the latest sequencing technology enabling simultaneous typing and investigated amino acid polymorphisms at HLA loci in combination with KIR haplotype.","[Yahara, H.] Natl Ctr Global Hlth & Med, Res Inst, Dept Mol Immunol & Inflammat, Tokyo, Japan; [Horita, S.] Fukushima Med Univ, Sch Med, Dept Bioregulat & Pharmacol Med, Fukushima, Japan; [Yanamoto, S.] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Clin Oral Oncol, Nagasaki, Japan; [Kitagawa, Y.; Asaka, T.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Dent Med, Dept Oral Diag & Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Yoda, T.; Morita, K.] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Maxillofacial Surg, Tokyo, Japan; [Morita, K.] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Bioresource Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Michi, Y.] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Tokyo, Japan; [Takechi, M.; Shimasue, H.] Hiroshima Univ, Grad Sch Biomed & Hlth Sci, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Hiroshima, Japan; [Maruoka, Y.] Natl Ctr Global Hlth & Med, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Ctr Hosp, Tokyo, Japan; [Kondo, E.] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dent & Oral Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kusukawa, J.] Kurume Univ, Dent & Oral Med Ctr, Sch Med, Fukuoka, Japan; [Tsujiguchi, H.; Nakamura, H.] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Adv Prevent Med Sci, Dept Environm & Prevent Med, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Sato, T.; Kannon, T.; Tajima, A.; Hosomichi, K.] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Adv Prevent Med Sci, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208640, Japan; [Yahara, K.] Natl Inst Infect Dis, Antimicrobial Resistance Res Ctr, 4-2-1 Aobacho, Tokyo 1890002, Japan","Hosomichi, K (reprint author), Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Adv Prevent Med Sci, Dept Bioinformat & Genom, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208640, Japan.; Yahara, K (reprint author), Natl Inst Infect Dis, Antimicrobial Resistance Res Ctr, 4-2-1 Aobacho, Tokyo 1890002, Japan.; Yahara, H (reprint author), Natl Ctr Global Hlth & Med, Res Inst, Genome Med Sci Project Toyama, Shinjuku Ku, 1-21-1 Toyama, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.",h-yahara@ri.ncgm.go.jp; khosomic@med.kanazawa-u.ac.jp; k-yahara@nih.go.ip,"Tajima, Atsushi/C-1053-2008; Hosomichi, Kazuyoshi/K-9477-2015","Tajima, Atsushi/0000-0001-6808-5491; Hosomichi, Kazuyoshi/0000-0003-2712-1825; Yanamoto, Souichi/0000-0003-2372-8347","JSPS Research Fellowships for Young ScientistsMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Education, Culture, Science, Sports, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan [15H06794, 16H06502, 19H05344]","We thank Dr. Simon Kollnberger (Cardiff Institute of Infection and Immunity) and Dr. Noriko Sorimachi (National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan) for helpful discussions.

The controllable creation and manipulation of bimerons are crucial for practical applications based on topological spin textures. Here, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic bimeron driven by a spin current. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the spin current can create an isolated bimeron in the antiferromagnetic thin film via the dampinglike spin torque. The spin current can also effectively drive the antiferromagnetic bimeron without a transverse drift. The steady motion of an antiferromagnetic bimeron is analytically derived and is in good agreement with the simulation results. Also, we find that the alternating-current-induced motion of the antiferromagnetic bimeron can be described by the Duffing equation due to the presence of the nonlinear boundary-induced force. The associated chaotic behavior of the bimeron is analyzed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents. Our results demonstrate the inertial dynamics of an antiferromagnetic bimeron, and may provide useful guidelines for building future bimeron-based spintronic devices.","[Shen, Laichuan; Xia, Jing; Zhang, Xichao; Zhou, Yan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Shen, Laichuan; Zhao, Guoping] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Ezawa, Motohiko] Univ Tokyo, Dept Appl Phys, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Tretiakov, Oleg A.] Univ New South Wales, Sch Phys, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Liu, Xiaoxi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Zhou, Y (reprint author), Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China.; Zhao, GP (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China.",zhaogp@uestc.edu.cn; zhouyan@cuhk.edu.cn,"Zhang, Xichao/L-4924-2013; Zhou, Yan/A-9690-2009; Tretiakov, Oleg/A-2795-2009","Zhang, Xichao/0000-0001-9656-9696; Zhou, Yan/0000-0001-5641-9191; Tretiakov, Oleg/0000-0001-7283-6884; Liu, Xiaoxi/0000-0001-5917-5495","Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ); JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K19074, 26600041, 22360122, JP18H03676, JP17K05490, JP15H05854]; CREST, JSTJapan Science & Technology Agency (JST)Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology (CREST) [JPMJCR16F1, JPMJCR1874]; Australian Research CouncilAustralian Research Council [DP200101027]; Cooperative Research Project Program at the Research Institute of Electrical Communication, Tohoku University; UNSW Science International Seed grant; National Natural Science Foundation of China of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51771127, 51571126, 51772004]; Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department [18TD0010, 16CZ0006]; President's Fund of CUHKSZ; Longgang Key Laboratory of Applied Spintronics; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11974298, 61961136006]; Shenzhen Fundamental Research Fund [JCYJ20170410171958839]; Shenzhen Peacock Group Plan [KQTD20180413181702403]","X.

This work aims to quantitatively discuss the influence of interfacial electron/ion transfer on the discharge characteristics of a solid-state battery cathode using the finite-element method. We used an in-house code to construct a composite cathode microstructure consisting of the coated AM and SE particles. To independently discuss the influence of bulk and interfacial properties, we first best estimated the bulk properties of AM based on single particle simulations and determined the properties of SE by referring to the model experiments. Using those bulk properties, we next investigated the electrochemical resistances arising from the electrochemical processes at the AM/AM, AM/SE, and SE/SE interfaces as well as those related to the buffer layer coating on the AM surface. Various interfacial parameters used in the electrochemical model are determined by validation with the experimental results of LiCoO2 (LCO), LiNbO3, and Li3.25Ge0.25P0.75S4 (LGPS) as the AM, coating material, and SE, respectively.

A straightforward route to light-driven water splitting is to apply self-supported particulate photocatalysts, which is expected to allow solar hydrogen to be competitive with fossil-fuel-derived hydrogen on a levelized cost basis. More importantly, the powder-based systems can lend themselves to making functional panels on a large scale while retaining the intrinsic activity of the photocatalyst. However, all attempts to generate hydrogen via powder-based solar water-splitting systems to date have unfortunately fallen short of the efficiency values required for practical applications. Photocatalysis on photocatalyst particles involves three sequential steps: (i) absorption of photons with higher energies than the bandgap of the photocatalysts, leading to the excitation of electron-hole pairs in the particles, (ii) charge separation and migration of these photoexcited carriers, and (iii) surface chemical reactions based on these carriers. In this review, we focus on the challenges of each step and summarize material design strategies to overcome the obstacles and limitations. This review illustrates that it is possible to employ the fundamental principles underlying photosynthesis and the tools of chemical and materials science to design and prepare photocatalysts for overall water splitting.","[Wang, Qian; Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Sci, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Wang, Qian] Univ Cambridge, Dept Chem, Lensfield Rd, Cambridge CB2 1EW, England","Domen, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.; Domen, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Sci, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",domen@chemsys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,"Wang, Qian/0000-0002-8980-4915; Domen, Kazunari/0000-0001-7995-4832","Artificial Photosynthesis Project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) [16H02417]; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science",This work was financially supported by the Artificial Photosynthesis Project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) and a Grant -in -Aid for Scientific Research(A) (no. 16H02417) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.,,635,14,14,192,254,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0009-2665,1520-6890,,CHEM REV,Chem.

Sericin and fibroin were extracted from the silk waste, and fibroin was successfully separated from the mixture. Thus, the proposed process of regeneration of useful components from silk selvage waste was effective and beneficial. We further investigated the use of the regenerated fibroin to fabricate highly functional nanofibers via electrospinning. The electrospinning solvent systems and processing conditions, such as voltage, tip-to-collector distance, and flow rate, were intensively studied. The selection of proper solvent was important to control the morphology and quality of the resultant nanofibers. Fibroin nanofibers fabricated using formic acid exhibited highly controlled uniformity. Additionally, composite PVA/fibroin nanofibers were successfully fabricated from the regenerated fibroin. Our studies highlight the potential of silk selvage, which is not a waste product but a valuable material, and it can be recycled via the proposed process to yield functional nanofiber materials suitable for cutting-edge nano/biotechnological applications owing to their biocompatibility.","[Lee, Hoik; Choi, Hyeong Yeol] Korea Inst Ind Technol, Smart Text R&D Grp, Res Inst Ind Technol Convergence, Ansan 15588, South Korea; [Park, Seon Ju; Kim, Kyu Beom] Gyeong Nam Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Text Design, 33 Dongjin Ro, Jinju Si 52725, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea; [Lee, Mi-eun; Choi, Kang-min] BJ Silk, 17 Worasan Ro 996 Beon Gil, Jinju Si 52834, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea; [Choi, Hyeong Yeol] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Adv Organ Mat & Text Syst Engn, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Hasegawa, Yohei] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Kim, Myungwoong] Inha Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea","Kim, KB (reprint author), Gyeong Nam Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Text Design, 33 Dongjin Ro, Jinju Si 52725, Gyeongsangnam D, South Korea.; Kim, M (reprint author), Inha Univ, Dept Chem & Chem Engn, Incheon 22212, South Korea.",mkim233@inha.ac.kr; kbkim@gntech.ac.kr,"Kim, Myungwoong/AAK-9052-2020","Kim, Myungwoong/0000-0003-0611-8694",Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology Grant 2018-2020,This work was supported by Gyeongnam National University of Science and Technology Grant 2018-2020.,,29,0,0,10,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0170-0839,1436-2449,,POLYM BULL,Polym.

The most electronegative low-density lipoprotein, L5, signals through LOX-1 to trigger atherogenesis. We examined the characteristics of LOX-1 and the role of L5 in aspirated coronary thrombi of AMI patients. Methods and Results Intracoronary thrombi were aspirated by performing interventional thrombosuction in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; n=32) or non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (n=12). LOX-1 level and the ratio of sLOX-1 to membrane-bound LOX-1 were higher in thrombi of STEMI patients than in those of non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients. In all aspirated thrombi, LOX-1 colocalized with apoB100. When we explored the role of L5 in AMI, deconvolution microscopy showed that particles of L5 but not L1 (the least electronegative low-density lipoprotein) quickly formed aggregates prone to retention in thrombi. Treating human monocytic THP-1 cells with L5 or L1 showed that L5 induced cellular adhesion and promoted the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages in a dose-dependent manner. In a second cohort of AMI patients, the L5 percentage and plasma concentration of sLOX-1 were higher in STEMI patients (n=33) than in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients (n=25), and sLOX-1 level positively correlated with L5 level in AMI patients. Conclusions The level of LOX-1 and the ratio of sLOX-1 to membrane-bound LOX-1 in aspirated thrombi, as well as the circulating level of sLOX-1 were higher in STEMI patients than in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients. L5 may play a role in releasing a high level of sLOX-1 into the circulation of STEMI patients.","[Lee, An-Sheng] Mackay Med Coll, Dept Med, New Taipei, Taiwan; [Lee, An-Sheng; Wang, Yu-Chen; Chang, Chia-Ming; Chang, Kuan-Cheng] China Med Univ Hosp, Cardiovasc Res Lab, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Chen] Asia Univ Hosp, Div Cardiovasc Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Chen] Asia Univ, Dept Biotechnol, Taichung, Taiwan; [Wang, Yu-Chen; Chang, Shih-Sheng; Lo, Ping-Hang; Chang, Kuan-Cheng] China Med Univ Hosp, Div Cardiovasc Med, Taichung, Taiwan; [Lu, Jonathan; Chen, Chu-Huang] Texas Heart Inst, Vasc & Med Res, Houston, TX 77025 USA; [Lu, Jonathan] InVitro Cell Res LLC, Englewood, NJ USA; [Burns, Alan R.] Univ Houston, Coll Optometry, Houston, TX USA; [Chen, Chu-Huang] New York Heart Res Fdn, Mineola, NY USA; [Kakino, Akemi; Sawamura, Tatsuya] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kakino, Akemi; Sawamura, Tatsuya] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Mol Pathophysiol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Chang, Kuan-Cheng] China Med Univ, Grad Inst Biomed Sci, Taichung, Taiwan","Sawamura, T (reprint author), 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Chang, KC (reprint author), 2 Yude Rd, Taichung 40447, Taiwan.",sawamura@shinshu-u.ac.jp; kuancheng.chang@gmail.com,,"Lee, An-sheng/0000-0001-8176-3269","Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC100-2314-B-039-040-MY3, MOST-104-2320-B-715-009-MY3, MOST 105-2314-B-039-041, MOST-106-2314-B-039-033, MOST-107-2320-B-715-002-MY3, MOST 107-2314-B-039-061, MOST 108-2314-B-039-055]; Mackay Medical College [1061B23, 1071B01]; Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare [MOHW107-TDU-B-212-123004]; China Medical University Hospital [DMR-CELL-1802, DMR-107-171, DMR-108-013, DMR108-180, DMR-107-014]","This research was supported in part by Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC100-2314-B-039-040-MY3, MOST-104-2320-B-715-009-MY3, MOST 105-2314-B-039-041, MOST-106-2314-B-039-033, MOST-107-2320-B-715-002-MY3, MOST 107-2314-B-039-061, and MOST 108-2314-B-039-055); Mackay Medical College (1061B23, 1071B01); Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW107-TDU-B-212-123004); and China Medical University Hospital (DMR-CELL-1802, DMR-107-171, and DMR-108-013, DMR108-180, DMR-107-014).",,45,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2047-9980,,,J AM HEART ASSOC,J.

Although it is widely believed that the disruption of the clathrate-like hydration shell drives this polymer collapse, no decisive evidence has yet been provided. Here, we demonstrate, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, that poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) in water has a less ordered hydration structure than the bulk liquid and undergoes the coil-to-globule transition without remarkable hydration shell depletion or qualitative transformation. Furthermore, our free energy analyses show that water strongly pushes the ""hydrophobic"" caprolactam groups apart rather than bringing them together. We find that the reduction of this water-mediated repulsion, arising from the change in free energies for cavity formation, drives the polymer collapse upon heating.","[Mochizuki, Kenji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem & Mat, Fac Textile Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Mochizuki, Kenji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Mochizuki, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Chem & Mat, Fac Textile Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Mochizuki, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",mochizuki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Mochizuki, Kenji/L-6385-2018","Mochizuki, Kenji/0000-0002-8947-9980","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18K19060, 18KK0151]; Inoue Foundation for Science (Inoue Science Research Award)Inoue Foundation for Science","We gratefully acknowledge Prof. Kenichiro Koga for helpful discussions.

Although HSCT is still widely adopted as part of salvage therapy for relapsed patients, there is no general consensus about the optimal transplant type (autologous [auto-HSCT] or allogeneic HSCT [allo-HSCT]). Procedures We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 95 childhood APL patients who underwent their first HSCT between 1990 and 2014. Of the 95 patients, 40 (42%), 41 (43%), and 3 (3%) underwent HSCT procedures after achieving their first complete remission (CR1), CR2, and CR3, respectively, and 11 (12%) underwent HSCT while in a non-CR state. Results The non-CR group exhibited significantly worse five-year overall survival (5yOS) and disease-free survival (5yDFS) (5yOS: 46%; 5yDFS: 46%) than the CR1 (5yOS: 80%; 5yDFS: 78%) and CR2 + CR3 groups (5yOS: 81%; 5yDFS: 76%) (P = 0.013 and P < 0.01, respectively). Of the patients treated in CR2, no significant differences in 5yOS or the five-year cumulative incidence of relapse (5yRI) were detected between the auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT groups (5yOS: 85%, vs 78%, P = 0.648; 5yRI: 9%, vs 11%, P = 0.828). Among the patients who underwent allo-HSCT in CR2, those with matched sibling donors displayed a significantly higher 5yRI (33%) than those with other types of donors (0%, P = 0.015). Conclusions Even after relapsing, childhood APL can be cured with HSCT if CR is achieved. These findings demonstrate that achieving CR followed by HSCT is the preferred strategy for treating children with relapsed or refractory APL.","[Yamamoto, Shohei] Showa Univ, Dept Pediat, Fujigaoka Hosp, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Tomizawa, Daisuke] Natl Ctr Child Hlth & Dev, Childrens Canc Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Kudo, Kazuko] Fujita Hlth Univ, Dept Pediat, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan; [Hasegawa, Daiichiro] Hyogo Prefectural Kobe Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Taga, Takashi] Shiga Univ Med Sci, Dept Pediat, Otsu, Shiga, Japan; [Yanada, Masamitsu] Fujita Hlth Univ, Dept Hematol, Toyoake, Aichi, Japan; [Kondo, Tadakazu] Kyoto Univ, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Kyoto, Japan; [Nakazawa, Yozo] Shinshu Univ, Dept Pediat, Sch Med, Nagano, Japan; [Eto, Tetsuya] Hamanomachi Hosp, Dept Hematol, Fukuoka, Japan; [Inoue, Masami] Osaka Med Ctr, Dept Hematol Oncol, Izumi, Japan; [Inoue, Masami] Res Inst Maternal & Child Hlth, Izumi, Japan; [Kato, Koji] Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hosp, Dept Hematol & Oncol, Childrens Med Ctr, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Atsuta, Yoshiko] Japanese Data Ctr Hematopoiet Cell Transplantat, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Ishida, Hiroyuki] Kyoto City Hosp, Dept Pediat, Kyoto, Japan","Yamamoto, S (reprint author), Showa Univ, Dept Pediat, Fujigaoka Hosp, Aoba Ku, 1-30 Fujigaoka, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2278501, Japan.",shohei-y@med.showa-u.ac.jp,,"Yamamoto, Shohei/0000-0003-1582-7062; Tomizawa, Daisuke/0000-0003-1520-7007",,,,24,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1545-5009,1545-5017,,PEDIATR BLOOD CANCER,Pediatr.

The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in a 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) at Week 24. Results Thirty-six patients were enrolled, of whom 35 patients were analysed for safety. The mean (standard error) changes from baseline to Week 24 in 6MWD were -17.0 (17.6) m in the placebo group (n = 10), -3.5 (20.3) m in the TAS-205 low-dose group (n = 11), and -7.5 (11.2) m in the TAS-205 high-dose group (n = 11). The mean (95% confidence interval) difference from the placebo group was 13.5 (-43.3 to 70.2) m in the TAS-205 low-dose group and 9.5 (-33.3 to 52.4) m in the TAS-205 high-dose group. No obvious differences were observed in the incidences of adverse events between treatment groups. No adverse drug reactions specific to TAS-205 treatment were observed. Interpretation The HPGDS inhibitor TAS-205 showed a favorable safety profile in DMD patients. Further research is required to examine the effectiveness of TAS-205 in a larger trial.","[Komaki, Hirofumi] Natl Ctr Hosp, Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Child Neurol, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878551, Japan; [Maegaki, Yoshihiro] Tottori Univ, Fac Med, Dept Brain & Neurosci, Div Child Neurol, Tottori, Japan; [Matsumura, Tsuyoshi] Natl Hosp Org Osaka Toneyama Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Osaka, Japan; [Shiraishi, Kazuhiro] Natl Hosp Org, Dept Pediat, Utano Natl Hosp, Kyoto, Japan; [Awano, Hiroyuki] Kobe Univ, Dept Pediat, Grad Sch Med, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan; [Nakamura, Akinori] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med 3, Nagano, Japan; [Kinoshita, Satoru] Natl Hosp Org, Dept Pediat, Niigata Natl Hosp, Niigata, Japan; [Ogata, Katsuhisa] Natl Hosp Org, Dept Neurol, Higashisaitama Natl Hosp, Saitama, Japan; [Ishigaki, Keiko] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Dept Pediat, Tokyo, Japan; [Saitoh, Shinji] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Pediat & Neonatol, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Funato, Michinori] Natl Hosp Org, Dept Pediat, Nagara Med Ctr, Gifu, Japan; [Kuru, Satoshi] Natl Hosp Org, Dept Neurol, Suzuka Natl Hosp, Suzuka, Mie, Japan; [Nakayama, Takahiro] Yokohama Rosai Hosp, Dept Neurol, Div Neuromuscular Dis, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Iwata, Yasuyuki; Yajima, Hiroyuki] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Rehabil, Tokyo, Japan; [Takeda, Shin'ichi] Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Tokyo, Japan","Komaki, H (reprint author), Natl Ctr Hosp, Natl Ctr Neurol & Psychiat, Dept Child Neurol, 4-1-1 Ogawa Higashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 1878551, Japan.",komakih@ncnp.go.jp,,,"Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.","This study was funded by Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.

However, difficulties are associated with discriminating between dysfibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hypodysfibrinogenemia using routine analyses. We previously reported a heterozygous variant fibrinogen (gamma A289V; Kanazawa III) as hypodysfibrinogenemia; however, the same variant had previously been described as hypofibrinogenemia. To clarify the production of gamma A289V fibrinogen, we expressed recombinant gamma A289V (r-gamma A289V) fibrinogen and compared it with wild-type (WT) and adjacent recombinant variant fibrinogens. Methods Target mutations were introduced into a fibrinogen gamma-chain expression vector by site-directed mutagenesis, and the vector was then transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells to produce recombinant fibrinogen. Fibrinogen was purified from the plasma of the proposita, and culture media and fibrinogen functions were analyzed using fibrin polymerization, plasmin protection, and FXIIIa-catalyzed fibrinogen cross-linking. Results The fibrinogen concentration ratio of the culture media to cell lysates was markedly lower for r-gamma A289V fibrinogen than for WT. Because the secretion of recombinant gamma F290L (r-gamma F290L) fibrinogen was similar to WT, we compared r-gamma F290L fibrinogen functions with WT. The fibrin polymerization of Kanazawa III plasma (K-III) fibrinogen was significantly weaker than normal plasma fibrinogen. Moreover, K-III fibrinogen showed a markedly reduced ""D:D"" interaction. However, all functions of r-gamma F290L fibrinogen were similar to WT. An in silico analysis confirmed the above results. Conclusion The present results demonstrated that gamma A289 is crucial for the gamma-module structure, and the gamma A289V substitution markedly reduced fibrinogen secretion. Moreover, K-III fibrinogen showed markedly reduced fibrin polymerization and ""D:D"" interactions. gamma A289V fibrinogen was confirmed as hypodysfibrinogenemia.","[Kaido, Takahiro; Yoda, Masahiro; Kamijo, Tomu; Taira, Chiaki; Higuchi, Yumiko; Okumura, Nobuo] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Clin Lab Invest, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Okumura, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Biomed Lab Sci, Lab Clin Chem & Immunol, Sch Hlth Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",nobuoku@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Sicences KAKENHI [JP17K09009],"Japan Society for the Promotion of Sicences KAKENHI, Grant/Award Number: JP17K09009",,21,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-5521,1751-553X,,INT J LAB HEMATOL,Int.

Numerous species in this family remain undescribed or have unclear phylogenetic positions. In Asia specifically, the species diversity of this family is almost completely unknown. However, many mycobionts of bryophytes belonging to several novel clades in Endogonaceae have recently been identified phylogenetically. Therefore, establishing a robust taxonomic system for this family is essential. We obtained numerous sporocarps of undescribed Endogonaceae-like species from the Japanese islands. Morphological observation and multilocus phylogenetic analysis of nuc 18S rDNA (18S), nuc 28S rDNA (28S), and portions of two nuclear protein-coding regions-translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and RNA polymerase II large subunit (rpb1)-from these species resulted in the description of one new species each of Endogone and Jimgerdemannia and two new species of Vinositunica, gen. nov. Because Vinositunica is characterized by purplish sporocarps and red-wine-colored chlamydospores up to 700 mu m in diameter, we emended the definition of Endogonaceae.","[Yamamoto, Kohei; Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci & Food Prod Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Degawa, Yousuke] Univ Tsukuba, Montane Sci Ctr, Sugadaira Res Stn, 1278-294 Sugadaira, Nagano 3862204, Japan; [Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Inst Mt Sci, Div Terr Ecosyst, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Yamamoto, Kohei] Tochigi Prefectural Museum, 2-2 Mutsumi Cho, Utsunomiya, Tochigi 3200865, Japan","Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci & Food Prod Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Mt Sci, Div Terr Ecosyst, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",akiyosh@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [14J09199]; KAKENHI from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25291084, 15H01751]",This study was supported by Research Fellowships for Young Scientists (no. 14J09199) and KAKENHI (nos. 25291084 and 15H01751) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).,,78,0,0,2,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0027-5514,1557-2536,,MYCOLOGIA,Mycologia,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00275514.2019.1689092,,20-Jan,20,Mycology,Mycology,KE7YS,WOS:000508767600001,31967533,,,,2020/4/20

We evaluated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis approaches after UCBT by comparing UCBT outcomes with GVHD prophylaxis using tacrolimus plus methylprednisolone (Tac/mPSL, n = 32) to that with Tac plus methotrexate (Tac/MTX, n = 31) at a single pediatric transplantation center. The 30-day cumulative incidence rates of neutrophil engraftment and median neutrophil engraftment times in the Tac/mPSL and Tac/MTX groups were 70.1% and 90.3% and 19 and 17 days, respectively (p = 0.09). Pre-engraftment immune reactions (PIR) and acute GVHD were improved with Tac/MTX; PIR incidence (p = 0.020) and cumulative incidence of 100-day acute GVHD (grade II-IV, 38.7% vs 68.8%, p = 0.045; grade III-IV, 9.7% vs 34.4%, p = 0.021) were significantly lower in the Tac/MTX group than in the Tac/mPSL group. However, the incidence rates of relapse (p = 0.921) and cytomegalovirus reactivation (p = 0.908), and the estimated overall (p = 0.87) and event-free survival (p = 0.88) were comparable between the two groups. These data indicate that GVHD prophylaxis with Tac/MTX is associated with favorable results, including reduced PIR and acute GVHD incidence after UCBT, without adverse effects.","[Shigemura, Tomonari; Okura, Eri; Morita, Daisuke; Hirabayashi, Koichi; Saito, Shoji; Tanaka, Miyuki; Nakazawa, Yozo] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sakashita, Kazuo; Komori, Kazutoshi; Kurata, Takashi] Nagano Childrens Hosp, Dept Hematol Oncol, Azumino, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Ryu] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Div Blood Transfus, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Shigemura, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Pediat, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tomonari@vivid.ocn.ne.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17K10104]",We thank Ms. Kanae Tanaka for coordinating the study.

An ERG and VEPs were recorded in an awake state and during anesthesia with three different minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC; 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5) of sevoflurane in group S or with three different effect-site concentrations (Ce) of 2, 3, and 4 mu g/ml by using a target-controlled infusion technique in group P. Sevoflurane and propofol had little effect on amplitudes of the ERG b-wave. Sevoflurane significantly attenuated the amplitudes of VEP N75-P100 at 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 MAC. Propofol did not significantly decrease the amplitude of VEPs at Ce of 2 or 3 mu g/ml but significantly decreased it at Ce of 4 mu g/ml. In summary, propofol and sevoflurane at clinical concentrations had little effect on the amplitude of an ERG. Sevoflurane attenuated the amplitudes of VEPs even at low concentrations.

To create a sustainable, robust international partnership to promote research integrity in the region, the purpose of this 2017 meeting was to foster multi-national awareness, understanding, and opportunities for collaboration. The meeting was defined by four objectives that emerged from the previous meetings: (1) Articulate differences as well as areas of common ground; (2) Identify best or recommended practices; (3) Identify opportunities for research or collaboration; and (4) Set an APRI network agenda for coming years. The key anticipated outcome was to advance the conversation surrounding research integrity among academic institutions and regulators in Asian and Pacific Rim nations.

The metallic state of Rh-nanoparticles in Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was confirmed by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Raman results depicted good interaction between Rh-nanoparticles and fullerene-C60. To our delight, the present Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 showed excellent catalytic activity in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH4 in water. Very high k(app), k' and TOF values of 82.14 x 10(-3) min(-1), 4107 x 10(-3) min(-1) and 138 min(-1), respectively, were calculated for the Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 catalyzed reduction of 4-nitrophenol. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most efficient fullerene-based nanocatalyst for the rapid reduction of 4-nitrophenol reported to date. Moreover, the catalytic activity of Rh(0)NPs/Fullerene-C60 was also tested towards Suzuki cross-coupling reactions.

Flowering season and flower visitor assemblages, which also differ among the three morphs, may influence the evolution and maintenance of the differences in sex expression and mating systems in the morphs.","[Toji, Tsubasa] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Itino, Takao] Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Itino, Takao] Shinshu Univ, Inst Mt Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Toji, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",17ss504j@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Toji, Tsubasa/0000-0003-4899-3390","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [15H02641]; Nagano Society for the Promotion of Science","Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Grant/Award Number: 15H02641 to TI; Nagano Society for the Promotion of Science",,29,0,0,2,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0913-557X,1442-1984,,PLANT SPEC BIOL,Plant Spec.

Interferon gamma (IFN gamma)-primed macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [M(IFN gamma+LPS)] produce high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12, TNF alpha, and IL-6 and low levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while those stimulated with LPS in the presence of the immune complex (IC) [M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC)] produce high levels of IL-10 and low levels of IL-12. In this study, we investigated the plasticity between M(IFN gamma+LPS) and M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) in vitro and compared one of the active histone marks [histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3)] between M(IFN gamma+LPS) and M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) using murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. We found that in an in vitro system, macrophages exhibited functional plasticity from M(LPS) to M(LPS+IC) upon repolarization after 2 days of washout period while IFN gamma priming before LPS stimulation prevented this repolarization. Phosphorylation of p38, SAPK/JNK, and NF-kappa B p65 in M(LPS+IC) repolarized from M(LPS) was similar to that in M(LPS+IC) polarized from resting macrophages. To obtain the epigenetic profiles of M(IFN gamma+LPS) and M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC), the global enrichment of H3K4me3 was evaluated. M(IFN gamma+LPS) and M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) displayed marked differences in genome-wide enrichment of H3K4me3. M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) showed increased global enrichment of H3K4me3, whereas M(IFN gamma+LPS) showed decreased enrichment when compared to unstimulated macrophages. Furthermore, M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) exhibited high levels of H3K4me3 enrichment in all cis-regulatory elements. At the individual gene level, the results showed increased H3K4me3 enrichment in the promoters of known genes associated with M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC), including Il10, Cxcl1, Csf3, and Il33, when compared with those of M(IFN gamma+LPS). Finally, we investigated the impact of M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) on the systemic immune response by adoptive transfer of M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) in an LPS-induced endotoxemia model. The cytokine profile revealed that mice with adoptively transferred M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) had acutely reduced serum levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and IL-p12p70. This study highlights the importance of epigenetics in regulating macrophage activation and the functions of M(IFN gamma+LPS+IC) that may influence macrophage plasticity and the potential therapeutic use of macrophage transfer in vivo.","[Ruenjaiman, Vichaya; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Palaga, Tanapat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Grad Sch, Interdisciplinary Grad Program Med Microbiol, Bangkok, Thailand; [Ruenjaiman, Vichaya; Leelahavanichkul, Asada; Palaga, Tanapat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Immunol & Immune Mediated Dis, Bangkok, Thailand; [Butta, Patcharavadee; Palaga, Tanapat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Leu, Yu-Wei] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Life Sci, Chiayi, Taiwan; [Pongpanich, Monnat] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Bangkok, Thailand; [Kueanjinda, Patipark] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Inst Biomed Sci, Nagano, Japan","Palaga, T (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Grad Sch, Interdisciplinary Grad Program Med Microbiol, Bangkok, Thailand.; Palaga, T (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Ctr Excellence Immunol & Immune Mediated Dis, Bangkok, Thailand.; Palaga, T (reprint author), Chulalongkorn Univ, Dept Microbiol, Fac Sci, Bangkok, Thailand.",tanapat.p@chula.ac.th,,,"Thailand Research Fund (TRF)Thailand Research Fund (TRF) [BRG5880007]; Ratchadapisek Sompoch Endowment Fund from Chulalongkorn University [760001-HR]; 100th Anniversary Chulalongkorn University Fund for Doctoral Scholarship, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand","This work was supported in part by the Thailand Research Fund (TRF Grant No. BRG5880007), and the Ratchadapisek Sompoch Endowment Fund from Chulalongkorn University (760001-HR) to TP and AL.

In Brassica species, root-herbivory leads to the accumulation of glucosinolates (GSLs) in the taproot, the most valuable belowground plant organ. Accumulation of GSLs can result from local biosynthesis in response to herbivory. In addition, transport from distal tissues by specialized GSL transporter proteins can play a role as well. GSL biosynthesis and transport are both inducible, but the role these processes play in GSL accumulation during root-herbivory is not yet clear. To address this issue, we performed two time-series experiments to study the dynamics of transport and biosynthesis in local and distal tissues of Brassica rapa. We exposed roots of B. rapa to herbivory by the specialist root herbivore Delia radicum for 7 days. During this period, we sampled above- and belowground plant organs 12 h, 24 h, 3 days and 7 days after the start of herbivory. Next, we measured the quantity and composition of GSL profiles together with the expression of genes involved in GSL biosynthesis and transport. We found that both benzyl and indole GSLs accumulate in the taproot during root-herbivory, whereas we did not observe any changes in aliphatic GSL levels. The rise in indole GSL levels coincided with increased local expression of biosynthesis and transporter genes, which suggest that both biosynthesis and GSL transport play a role in the accumulation of GSLs during root herbivory. However, we did not observe a decrease in GSL levels in distal tissues. We therefore hypothesize that GSL transporters help to retain GSLs in the taproot during root-herbivory.","[Touw, Axel; Maedicke, Anne; Sontowski, Rebekka; van Dam, Nicole M.] German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Mol Interact Ecol, Leipzig, Germany; [Touw, Axel; Maedicke, Anne; Sontowski, Rebekka; van Dam, Nicole M.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany; [Verdecia-Mogena, Arletys] Ctr Genet Engn & Biotechnol, Res & Dev Dept, Camaguey, Cuba; [Tsunoda, Tomonori] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Matsumoto, Kamiina county, Japan","Touw, A (reprint author), German Ctr Integrat Biodivers Res iDiv, Mol Interact Ecol, Leipzig, Germany.; Touw, A (reprint author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Biodivers, Jena, Germany.",axel.touw@idiv.de,"Tsunoda, Tomonori/AAH-8628-2020; Touw, Axel J./AAD-6595-2020",,ThULB (Thuringer Universitats-und Landesbibliothek Jena); iDiv Open Science Publication Fund,The authors acknowledge support from the Open Access Fund of the ThULB (Thuringer Universitats-und Landesbibliothek Jena) and the iDiv Open Science Publication Fund for their contribution to the publication fee.,,53,0,0,4,4,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-462X,,,FRONT PLANT SCI,Front.

We conclude that the first appearance datum for the Sangiran hominins is most likely similar to 1.3 million years ago and less than 1.5 million years ago, which is markedly later than the dates that have been widely accepted for the past two decades.","[Matsu'ura, Shuji] Natl Museum Nat 2and Sci, Dept Anthropol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan; [Kondo, Megumi] Ochanomizu Univ, Lab Phys Anthropol, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1128610, Japan; [Danhara, Tohru] Kyoto FissionTrack Corp Ltd, Kita Ku, Kyoto 6038832, Japan; [Sakata, Shuhei] Univ Tokyo, Earthquake Res Inst, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Hirata, Takafumi] Univ Tokyo, Geochem Res Ctr, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [Kumiawan, Iwan; Setiyabudi, Erick] Ctr Geol Survey, Bandung 40122, Indonesia; [Takeshita, Yoshihiro] Shinshu Univ, Inst Educ, Nagano 3808544, Japan; [Hyodo, Masayuki] Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Inland Seas, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Hyodo, Masayuki] Kobe Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Planetol, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Kitaba, Ikuko] Ritsumeikan Univ, Res Ctr Palaeoclimatol, Shiga 5258577, Japan; [Sudo, Masafumi] Univ Potsdam, Inst Geosci, D-14476 Golm, Germany","Matsu'ura, S (reprint author), Natl Museum Nat 2and Sci, Dept Anthropol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan.; Hyodo, M (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Inland Seas, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.; Hyodo, M (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Planetol, Nada Ku, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",matsu-ur@js2.so-net.ne.jp; mhyodo@kobe-u.ac.jp,,"Setiabudi, Erick/0000-0002-8417-4133","Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [13440255, 15403015, 18200053, 22320154]; NMNS (fund) [6503]","This study was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (grants 13440255, 15403015, 18200053, and 22320154) and by NMNS (fund no. 6503).",,88,1,1,2,2,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",0036-8075,1095-9203,,SCIENCE,Science,10-Jan,2020,367,6474,,,,,210,+,,10.1126/science.aau8556,,,31,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,KB9MK,WOS:000506811300044,31919224,,,,2020/4/20

In these days, immunotherapies, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors, are focused on. Though many types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are there, the difference of effect and its mechanism are unclear. Some reports suggest the response rate of anti-PD-1 antibody is superior to that of anti-PD-L1 antibody and could potentially produce different mechanisms of action. On the other hand, Treg also express PD-1; however, their relationship remains unclear. Methods In this study, we used osteosarcoma cell lines in vitro and osteosarcoma mouse model in vivo. In vitro, we analyzed the effect of IFN gamma for expression of PD-L1 on the surface of cell lines by flowcytometry. In vivo, murine osteosarcoma cell line LM8 was subcutaneously transplanted into the dorsum of mice. Mouse anti-PD-1 antibody was intraperitoneally administered. we analysed the effect for survival of anti-PD-1 antibody and proportion of T cells in the tumour by flowcytometry. Results We discovered that IFN gamma increased PD-L1 expression on the surface of osteosarcoma cell lines. In assessing the relationship between anti-PD-1 antibody and Treg, we discovered the administration of anti-PD-1 antibody suppresses increases in tumour volume and prolongs overall survival time. In the tumour microenvironment, we found that the administration of anti-PD-1 antibody decreased Treg within the tumour and increased tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. Conclusions Here we clarify for the first time an additional mechanism of anti-tumour effect-as exerted by anti-PD-1 antibody decreasing Treg- we anticipate that our findings will lead to the development of new methods for cancer treatment.","[Yoshida, Kazushige; Okamoto, Masanori; Sasaki, Jun; Ideta, Hirokazu; Kamanaka, Takayuki; Sobajima, Atsushi; Takizawa, Takashi; Kato, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kuroda, Chika; Ishida, Haruka; Ueda, Katsuya; Uemura, Takeshi; Haniu, Hisao; Saito, Naoto] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Tanaka, Manabu] Okaya City Hosp, Dept Orthoped Surg, Okaya, Japan; [Aoki, Kaoru] Shinshu Univ, Sch Hlth Sci, Phys Therapy Div, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Okamoto, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.; Saito, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",ryouyvma@shinsnu-u.ac.jp; saitoko@sninshu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16 K20045, 18 K16652]","This research was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (grant no. 16 K20045 and 18 K16652).

We aimed to classify IgG4-RD by a combination pattern of affected organs and identify the clinical features, including the comorbidities of each subgroup. Methods: Patients diagnosed with IgG4-RD between April 1996 and June 2018 were enrolled from three institutes. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using six frequently affected organs (lacrimal gland and/or orbit, salivary gland, lung, pancreas, kidney, and retroperitone and/or aorta). Clinical features, such as comorbidities and outcomes, were compared between clusters. Results: In total, 108 patients enrolled in this cohort could be stratified into five distinct subgroups: group 1, lung dominant group; group 2, retroperitoneal fibrosis and/or aortitis dominant group; group 3, salivary glands limited group; group 4, Mikulicz's disease dominant group; and group 5, autoimmune pancreatitis with systemic involvement group. There were significant between-group differences in sex (male dominant in group 1, 2, and 5), history of asthma and allergies on the respiratory tract (most frequent in group 5), and malignancy (most frequent in group 5). Conclusion: IgG4-RD can be classified into subgroups according to the pattern of affected organs.

Similarly, human studies have shown that abdominal breathing can induce thoracic lymph drainage. In these studies, lymph flow was measured by hemodilution and a corresponding reduction in blood anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) levels, the latter being linked to urine osmolarity. Hence, we questioned if induction of lymph flow through water administration and supine positioning could be measured by monitoring urine osmolarity. Methods and Results: Volunteers were given 250 mL of distilled water and then made to rest for either 10 or 30 minutes in a supine position. Blood samples were taken pre and postrest to monitor changes in plasma ADH, total protein, plasma albumin, red blood cell, and hemoglobin concentrations. Urine was collected to monitor [Na+], [Cl-], and osmolarity. Intake of 250 mL distilled water with 10-minute rest caused a significant reduction in plasma ADH concentration, with decreases in urine [Na+], [Cl-], and osmolarity. We found a linear relationship between the ratio of plasma ADH concentrations after/before rest (between 1.1 and 3.0 pg center dot mL) and the ratio of urine osmolarity after/before rest (between 180 and 601 mOsm center dot L). Conclusions: Intake of 250 mL distilled water with 10-minute rest in a supine position caused hemodilution and a reduction in urine osmolarity consistent with thoracic lymph drainage. Urine osmolarity is a simple, safe clinical measure for monitoring lymph flow that could be used to evaluate the technique of lymph edema therapists.","[Hayashi, Moyuru; Watanabe-Asaka, Tomomi; Maejima, Daisuke; Nagashio, Sachiho; Kajihara, Ryo; Amari, Kei; Yokoyama, Yumiko; Kaidoh, Maki; Kawai, Yoshiko; Ohhashi, Toshio] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Innovat Med & Hlth Sci Res, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hayashi, Moyuru; Watanabe-Asaka, Tomomi; Kawai, Yoshiko] Tohoku Med & Pharmaceut Univ, Fac Med, Div Physiol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Nagashio, Sachiho; Kajihara, Ryo; Amari, Kei] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dent & Oral Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Sugano, Mitsutoshi; Honda, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Ohhashi, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Innovat Med & Hlth Sci Res, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",ohhashi@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"BOURBON, Co.

Although there are numerous therapeutic options for melanoma, the prognosis is still poor once it has metastasized. The main concern after removal of a primary melanoma is whether it has metastasized, and early detection of metastatic melanoma would be effective in improving the prognosis of patients. Thus, it is very important to identify reliable methods to detect metastases as early as possible. Although many prognostic biomarkers (mainly for metastases) of melanoma have been reported, there are very few effective for an early diagnosis. Serum and urinary biomarkers for melanoma diagnosis have especially received great interest because of the relative ease of sample collection and handling. Several serum and urinary biomarkers appear to have significant potential both as prognostic indicators and as targets for future therapeutic methods, but still there are no efficient serum and urinary biomarkers for early detection, accurate diagnosis and prognosis, efficient monitoring of the disease and reliable prediction of survival and recurrence. Levels of 5-S-cysteinyldopa (5SCD) in the serum or urine as biomarkers of melanoma have been found to be significantly elevated earlier and to reflect melanoma progression better than physical examinations, laboratory tests and imaging techniques, such as scintigraphy and echography. With recent developments in the treatment of melanoma, studies reporting combinations of 5SCD levels and new applications for the treatment of melanoma are gradually increasing. This review summarizes the usefulness of 5SCD, the most widely used and well-known melanoma marker in the serum and urine, compares 5SCD and other useful markers, and finally its application to other fields.","[Wakamatsu, Kazumasa] Fujita Hlth Univ, Sch Med Sci, Dept Chem, 1-98 Dengakugakubo,Kutsukake Cho, Toyoake, Aichi 4701192, Japan; [Fukushima, Satoshi; Ihn, Hironobu] Kumamoto Univ, Fac Life Sci, Dept Dermatol & Plast Surg, Chuo Ku, 1-1-1 Honjo, Kumamoto 8608556, Japan; [Minagawa, Akane; Omodaka, Toshikazu; Okuyama, Ryuhei] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dermatol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hida, Tokimasa; Uhara, Hisashi] Sapporo Med Univ, Dept Dermatol, Sch Med, Chuo Ku, South 1,West 16, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608543, Japan; [Hatta, Naohito] Toyama Prefectural Cent Hosp, Dept Dermatol, 2-2-78 Nishinagae, Toyama, Toyama 9308550, Japan; [Takata, Minoru] Okayama Univ, Dept Dermatol, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Kita Ku, 2-5-1 Shikada Cho, Okayama 7008558, Japan","Wakamatsu, K (reprint author), Fujita Hlth Univ, Sch Med Sci, Dept Chem, 1-98 Dengakugakubo,Kutsukake Cho, Toyoake, Aichi 4701192, Japan.",kwaka@fujita-hu.ac.jp; satoshi.fukushima.tb@gmail.com; akn@shinshu-u.ac.jp; d05dsm019@shinshu-u.ac.jp; hidat@sapmed.ac.jp; hattanao@tch.pref.toyama.jp; mtakata@onyx.ocn.ne.jp; uharah@sapmed.ac.jp; rokuyama@shinshu-u.ac.jp; ihn-der@kumamoto-u.ac.jp,"Hida, Tokimasa/AAH-7333-2019","Hida, Tokimasa/0000-0003-3662-0095; Fukushima, Satoshi/0000-0002-0622-7682; HATTA, NAOHITO/0000-0003-1590-8348; Wakamatsu, Kazumasa/0000-0003-1748-9001","Ministry of Education, Science, and CultureMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [02670487]; Ministry of Health and Welfare, JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [3-20]; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [11-7]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [18K08301]","This work was supported by a Scholarship donation (Fujita Health University), by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture, no. 02670487, and from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, no. 3-20, Japan, and for Cancer Research from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (11-7) to KW, and Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (Grant Number, 18K08301) to SF.",,126,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

The magnetic susceptibility and Verdet constant of TMPA TFSI also were slightly changed over 3 T. The MFI phase formation was almost completed within 3 h after TMPA TFSI liquid was exposed to a 6 T magnetic field, as demonstrated by the melting behavior of TMPA TFSI solid frozen instantaneously under 6 T. Multivariate analysis of the Raman spectra suggested that the MFI transformation should be associated with the conformational change of the transoid-to-cisoidlike species of TFSI ions.

We evaluated whether a history of fragility fracture was associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing after tooth extraction in older adults in Japan. Materials and methods Of 5352 people aged 50-89 years in the 2014 basic resident registry of the town of Obuse, the present study included 376 subjects (190 men and 186 women) who completed a structured questionnaire and measurement of the bone mineral densities (BMDs) of the bilateral femoral neck. Delayed wound healing after tooth extraction was self-reported. Fragility fractures were confirmed via examination of hospital medical records. Logistic regression analyses adjusted for age and gender were used to evaluate association of clinical variables with delayed would healing after tooth extractions. Odds ratios (ORs) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of all possible associated variables for the presence of delayed wound healing were calculated. Results Subjects with a history of fragility fractures had a significantly higher risk of delayed wound healing compared with those without previous fragility fractures (OR 2.68; 95% CI 1.11-6.46, p = 0.028). This association still remained after adjusted for all other variables (OR 2.70; 95% CI 1.10-6.60, p = 0.030). Delayed wound healing was not significantly associated with the BMD of the femoral neck. Conclusions History of fragility fracture may be associated with increased risk of delayed wound healing after tooth extraction in Japanese men and women aged 50-89 years.","[Taguchi, Akira] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, Sch Dent, 1780 Gobara, Nagano 3990781, Japan; [Ikegami, Shota; Horiuchi, Hiroshi; Takahashi, Jun; Kato, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Ikegami, Shota; Tokida, Ryosuke; Horiuchi, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Rehabil Ctr, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Kamimura, Mikio] Kamimura Orthoped Clin, Ctr Osteoporosis & Spinal Disorders, 595-17 Kotobuki, Matsumoto, Nagano 3990021, Japan; [Sakai, Noriko] Nagano Childrens Hosp, 3100 Toyoshina, Nagano 3998288, Japan","Taguchi, A (reprint author), Matsumoto Dent Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, Sch Dent, 1780 Gobara, Nagano 3990781, Japan.",akira.taguchi@mdu.ac.jp,,"Taguchi, Akira/0000-0003-2620-1487","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18K09758, JP18K09611]; Japanese Orthopaedic AssociationJapanese Orthopaedic Association; Japanese Society for Musculoskeletal Medicine; Nakatomi Foundation","We thank Kelly Zammit, BVSc, from Edanz Editing (www.edanzediting.com/ac), for editing a draft of this manuscript.

The risk factors associated with postoperative pneumonia are poor general health, smoking, decreased pulmonary function, diabetes mellitus, surgical stress, old age, postoperative aspiration, and oral hygiene. In this study, we examined the effect of perioperative oral care on reducing postoperative pneumonia since the evidence to-date is not clear. Methods A multicenter, retrospective investigation of the relationship between perioperative oral care and incidence of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery was conducted. A total of 775 patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophageal resection at 25 hospitals between 2016 and 2017 were enrolled in the study. Various factors were examined for correlation with development of postoperative pneumonia. Results Multivariate analysis showed that old age, smoking habit, lower hemoglobin, higher creatinine, postoperative dysphagia, and lack of oral care intervention were independent risk factors for pneumonia. Oral care was more effective in preventing pneumonia in hospitals in which the incidence of postoperative pneumonia was lower than 20%, while it was not effective in hospitals in which the incidence was higher than 20%. Conclusion Results of the study suggest that it is recommended to carry out perioperative oral care in esophageal cancer surgery.","[Soutome, Sakiko] Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Oral Management Ctr, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan; [Hasegawa, Takumi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Chuo Ku, 7-5-1 Kusunoki Cho, Kobe, Hyogo 6500017, Japan; [Yamguchi, Taihei] Kagoshima Univ, Dept Prevent Dent Res Field Dent Med & Dent Sci A, 8-35-1 Sakuragaoka, Kagoshima 8908544, Japan; [Aoki, Kumiko] Nara Med Univ, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, 840 Shijo Cho, Kashihara, Nara 6348521, Japan; [Kanamura, Naritomo] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Dent Med, Kamigyo Ku, Kyoto 6028566, Japan; [Mukai, Takao] Kindai Univ Hosp, Dept Oral Maxillofacial Surg, 337-2 Ono Higashi, Sayama, Osaka 5898511, Japan; [Yamazoe, Junichi] Kyushu Univ Hosp, Perioperat Oral Care Ctr, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8120054, Japan; [Yamazoe, Junichi] Kyushu Univ Hosp, Div Gen Oral Care, Higashi Ku, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8120054, Japan; [Nishikawa, Masaya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Nishikawa, Masaya] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Tissue Engn, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Isomura, Emiko] Osaka Univ, Unit Dent, 2-15 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Isomura, Emiko] Osaka Univ, Osaka Univ Hosp, Grad Sch Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg 1, 2-15 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Hoshi, Kazuto] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Umeda, Masahiro] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Clin Oral Oncol, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan; [Kogami, Jun-ya] Asahikawa Med Univ Hosp, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan; [Sawaki, Kouichi] Hiroshima City Hosp, Hiroshima, Japan; [Nobuhara, Hiroshi] Hiroshima Prefectural Hosp, Hiroshima, Japan; [Tachibana, Sinsho] Kakogawa Cent City Hosp, Kakogawaa, Hyogo, Japan; [Kojima, Yuka] Kansai Med Univ Hosp, Moriguchi, Osaka, Japan; [Kubota, Minoru] Kurashiki Cent Hosp, Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan; [Baba, Sonoe] Miyazaki Univ Hosp, Miyazaki, Japan; [Yamauchi, Chika] Nagoya City Univ Hosp, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Ono, Keiichiro] Natl Hosp Org, Beppu Med Ctr, Beppu, Oita, Japan; [Morioka, Masashi] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yamaguchi, Yuka] Toho Univ, Omori Hosp, Med Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Yamauchi, Toshihiro] Komagome Hosp, Tokyo Metropolitan Canc & Infect Dis Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakajo, Chie] Toyama Prefectural Cent Hosp, Toyama, Japan; [Tomihara, Kei] Toyama Univ Hosp, Toyama, Japan; [Yamamoto, Toshiro] Univ Hosp Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Kyoto, Japan; [Yamamori, Iku] Yamagata Univ Hosp, Yamagata, Japan","Soutome, S (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Oral Management Ctr, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan.",sakiko@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,,,,,36,0,0,5,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0941-4355,1433-7339,,SUPPORT CARE CANCER,Support.

If medical images can be evaluated using artificial intelligence, this could substantially improve examination efficiency. OBJECTIVE: We investigated an evaluation system for medical images with different noise characteristics using a deep convolutional neural network. METHODS: Simulated computed tomography images are the targets of the system. We used an AlexNet trained with natural images for the deep convolutional neural network and a support vector machine for classification. Synthetic computed tomography images with circular and rectangular signal bodies at different levels of contrast and added Gaussian noise were used for training and testing. RESULTS: Two transfer learning methods were tested: classification by a re-trained support vector machine using the AlexNet features, and a method that fine-tuned the deep convolutional neural network. Using the first method, all the test image noise levels could be classified correctly. The fine-tuning method achieved an accuracy rate of 92.6%. CONCLUSIONS: An image quality evaluation method using artificial intelligence will be useful for clinical images and different image quality indices in the future.","[Hayashi, Norio; Watanabe, Haruyuki; Ogura, Toshihiro; Ogura, Akio] Gunma Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Maebashi, Gumma 3718511, Japan; [Maruyama, Tomoko; Sato, Yusuke] Gunma Prefectural Coll Hlth Sci, Grad Sch Radiol Technol, Gunma 3710052, Japan; [Maruyama, Tomoko] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Radiol, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Sato, Yusuke] Gunma Univ Hosp, Dept Radil Technol, Gunma 3718511, Japan","Hayashi, N (reprint author), Gunma Prefectural Coll Hlth Sci, Dept Radiol Technol, 323-1 Kamioki, Maebashi, Gunma 3710052, Japan.",hayashi@gchs.ac.jp,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-7329,1878-7401,,TECHNOL HEALTH CARE,Technol.

Neuropathologically, G-PD is characterized by abundant neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau, marked deposition of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43), and neuronal loss. The mechanisms that underlie neurodegeneration in G-PD are poorly understood. Here, we report that the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in G-PD brains. Specifically, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein/glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa and phosphorylated (activated) ER stress sensor protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase accumulate in G-PD brains. Furthermore, proteinaceous aggregates in G-PD brains are found to contain several proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy pathway, two major mechanisms for intracellular protein degradation. In particular, a mutant ubiquitin (UBBthorn1), whose presence is a marker for UPS dysfunction, is shown to accumulate in G-PD brains. We demonstrate that UBBthorn1 is a potent modifier of TDP-43 aggregation and cytotoxicity in vitro. Overall, these data suggest that UPR activation and intracellular proteolytic pathways are intimately connected with the accumulation of aggregated proteins in G-PD.","[Verheijen, Bert M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Translat Neurosci, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Brain Ctr, Univ Weg 100, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands; [Verheijen, Bert M.] Univ Utrecht, Dept Translat Neurosci, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Dept Neurol & Neurosurg, Utrecht, Netherlands; [Lussier, Celina; Mueller-Huebers, Cora; Braun, Ralf J.] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Cell Biol, Bayreuth, Germany; [Garruto, Ralph M.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Anthropol, Binghamton, NY USA; [Garruto, Ralph M.] SUNY Binghamton, Dept Biol Sci, Binghamton, NY USA; [Oyanagi, Kiyomitsu] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Div Neuropathol, Dept Brain Dis Res, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Oyanagi, Kiyomitsu] Hatsuishi Hosp, Brain Res Lab, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Braun, Ralf J.] Danube Private Univ, Fac Med Dental Med, Krems An Der Donau, Austria; [van Leeuwen, Fred W.] Maastricht Univ, Dept Neurosci, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Maastricht, Netherlands","Verheijen, BM (reprint author), Univ Utrecht, Dept Translat Neurosci, Univ Med Ctr Utrecht, Brain Ctr, Univ Weg 100, NL-3584 CG Utrecht, Netherlands.",l.m.verheijen-3@umcutrecht.nl,"Braun, Ralf/B-9123-2008","Braun, Ralf/0000-0003-4234-8163","U.S. National Institute of Health through the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke; NINDSUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS) [HHSN271200900479P, MI 609689]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K06754, 19K07820]; Brain Research Institute, Niigata University [2907, 201913]; Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Muskelkranke e.V.

Hydrogen embrittlement properties of the TM steels were improved by the alloying addition. Particularly, 1.0 mass% chromium added TM steel indicated excellent hydrogen embrittlement resistance. This effect was attributed to (1) the decrease in the diffusible hydrogen concentration at the uniform and fine prior austenite grain and packet, block, and lath boundaries; (2) the suppression of hydrogen trapping at martensite matrix/cementite interfaces owing to the suppression of precipitation of cementite at the coarse martensite lath matrix; and (3) the suppression of the hydrogen diffusion to the crack initiation sites owing to the high stability of retained austenite because of the existence of retained austenite in a large amount of the martensite-austenite constituent (M-A) phase in the TM steels containing 1.0 mass% chromium.","[Hojo, Tomohiko; Akiyama, Eiji] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Kobayashi, Junya] Ibaraki Univ, Coll Engn, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Ibaraki 3168511, Japan; [Sugimoto, Koh-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Syst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nagasaka, Akihiko] Nagano Coll, Natl Inst Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Nagano 3818550, Japan","Hojo, T (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan.",hojo@imr.tohoku.ac.jp; junya.kobayashi.jkoba@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp; sugimot@shinshu-u.ac.jp; nagasaka@nagano-nct.ac.jp; akiyama@imr.tohoku.ac.jp,"Hojo, Tomohiko/A-9265-2017; Akiyama, Eiji/H-2595-2011","Hojo, Tomohiko/0000-0002-2558-4781; Akiyama, Eiji/0000-0001-6916-3703",Suzuki Foundation; Okayama Foundation for Science and Technology; JKA,"This work was conducted with financial support by the JKA, Suzuki Foundation, and Okayama Foundation for Science and Technology.",,28,1,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4701,,METALS-BASEL,Metals,JAN,2020,10,1,,,,,,,6,10.3390/met10010006,,,13,"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering",Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering,KQ3LK,WOS:000516827800006,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020/4/20

We previously showed that human placental extract (hPE) was intramuscularly injected to ameliorates liver injury in a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced NASH model. In the present study, we investigated the effects of hPE using dB/dB mice which exhibit obesity and insulin resistance and are thought to reproduce the pathological background of NASH. The MCD-diet induced liver atrophy accompanied by fibrosis around the liver sinusoids. hPE dose-dependently reduced the perivascular fibrosis. Moreover, aSMA-positive activated hepatic stellate cells increased in number in mice on the MCD diet, with this effect reversed by hPE treatment. hPE significantly decreased expression of Acta2, Colla1, and Tgfb1 genes in hepatic stellate cells, and inhibited Smad phosphorylation. Moreover, hPE treatment increased the expression of the anti-oxidative genes Hmox1, Nqo1, Cat, and Sod1, and significantly enhanced nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 activity. Furthermore, hPE decreased the expression of Nox4 and attenuated the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species. These results, along with our previous study, suggest that hPE effectively ameliorates liver fibrosis in NASH. This beneficial effect may, in part, be due to suppression of hepatic stellate cell activation.","[Yamauchi, Akihiro; Tone, Takahiro; de Toledo, Andreia; Igarashi, Kyoko; Sugimoto, Koji; Miyai, Haruka; Deng, Dawei; Nakamura, Junichi; Hirano, Eiichi] Japan Bio Prod Co Ltd, Res Inst, 1-1 Kurume Res Ctr Bldg,2F, Kurume, Fukuoka 8390864, Japan; [Shindo, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Res, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Lim, Hong Seok; Kaku, Taiichi] Japan Bio Prod Co Ltd, 1-44-4 Tomigaya Shibuya Ku, Tokyo 1510063, Japan","Hirano, E (reprint author), Japan Bio Prod Co Ltd, Res Inst, 1-1 Kurume Res Ctr Bldg,2F, Kurume, Fukuoka 8390864, Japan.",ehirano@placenta-jbp.co.jp,,,"Japan Bio Products Co., Ltd.","This work was supported by Japan Bio Products Co., Ltd., as a collaborative project.",,38,0,0,0,0,BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PRESS LTD,SAPPORO,"HOKKAIDO UNIV, LAB HISTOLOGY & CYTOLOGY, C/O TOSHIHIKO IWANAGA, KITA 15-NISHI 7, SAPPORO, 060-8638, JAPAN",0388-6107,1880-313X,,BIOMED RES-TOKYO,Biomed.

Recently, cases of MERS with accompanying acute focal bacterial nephritis (AFBN) have been reported in children. This study aimed to clarify the clinical features of MERS with AFBN. Methods: A retrospective study of patients with MERS was conducted at Nagano Children's Hospital, Japan, from April 2013 to March 2018. The clinical signs and laboratory findings of MERS patients with AFBN (AFBN group) and without AFBN (non-AFBN group) were measured and compared. Results: Of 12 patients diagnosed as having MERS, 3 were also found to have AFBN. Seven of the 9 patients without AFBN were associated with infectious agents, including rotavirus and influenza viruses. No patient received steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and none displayed neurological sequelae. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were significantly higher in the AFBN group than in the non-AFBN group (14.7 mg/dL versus 0.8 mg/dL, P = 0.009). AFBN group patients were also significantly older (97 months versus 27 months, P = 0.018) and experienced significantly less frequent seizures (33% versus 100%, P = 0.045). The mean duration of neurological symptoms was significantly longer in the AFBN group than in the non-AFBN group (4 days versus 1.7 days, P = 0.013). Conclusions: Pediatric patients with AFBN often present with non-specific findings, such as fever and abdominal pain. Pediatricians should be aware of the possibility of AFBN in the clinical setting of MERS, particularly when the patient exhibits inexplicably high CRP.

However, its cycle durability requires improvement, even with a higher utilization ratio of the anode. The effect of lithium salts, LiPF6 and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) is investigated for usage in the LIC in severe conditions (utilization ratio of the anode: 20%). The LIC with LiTFSI delivered its initial capacity up to similar to 400 cycles, which is 4 times longer than the LIC with LiPF6. The reason for the capacity decay in the LiPF6 system is attributed to the narrowing of the potential range of the activated carbon cathode due to a widening potential range of the Sn-Ni alloy anode during operation. This widening is attributed to the loss of the active material due to peeling-off from the substrate. However, when LiTFSI is used, no such decay is observed. It is suggested that a polymer-like solid electrolyte interphase derived from TFSI- may suppress the loss of the active material. This finding can encourage the development of an Sn-based anode for LICs in combination with a mild operating condition and electrolyte additives.

However, the correlation between the energetics at photocatalyst/co-catalyst/water interfaces and their interfacial charge-transfer kinetics is still elusive, especially when the energetics are expected to vary spatially along the liquid-junction interface. First, we derived a kinetic model for photocatalyst particles in contact with two-redox potentials, H+/H-2 and O-2/H2O, i.e., a semiconductor/two-redox liquid junction. We adopted the principle of detailed balance proven for one-redox liquid junctions and extended this principle to a locally out-of-equilibrium electrolyte containing multiple redox potentials, the condition typical for photocatalysts. To validate the model, we established a characterization framework to simulate photocatalyst operation by using photoelectrodes. The open-circuit conditions mimicked operating photocatalyst surfaces; and the (quasi-) Fermi levels, probed by ohmic back contacts, indicated charge-separation efficiency. Quantitative data fitting further validated the two-redox kinetic model. These characterizations correlated local energetics with multi-electron charge-transfer kinetics, which exhibit tuneable branching ratios controlled by H-2-and-O-2 gas-mixture compositions and co-catalyst selectivity. Unlike the conventional photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces, SrTiO3 model particles decorated with Pt co-catalysts were found to bear liquid-junction interfaces of spatially varying energetics with designated reductive and oxidative sites. It is shown that, uniquely for photocatalysts, the local kinetic-controlled energetics vary spatially across photocatalyst/co-catalyst/water interfaces of individual particles, and affect charge-separation efficiency sensitively. The mutually dependent behaviour between local kinetics and spatially varying energetics were confirmed for two practical photocatalytic systems, Al-doped SrTiO3 and Ta3N5. This study exemplified and elucidated the design principles for developing efficient photocatalysts.","[Pan, Zhenhua; Yanagi, Rito; Shen, Xin; Zhu, Qianhong; Xue, Yudong; Rohr, Jason A.; Hu, Shu] Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Pan, Zhenhua; Yanagi, Rito; Shen, Xin; Zhu, Qianhong; Xue, Yudong; Rohr, Jason A.; Hu, Shu] Yale Univ, Energy Sci Inst, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA; [Wang, Qian] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138654, Japan; [Xue, Yudong] Chinese Acad Sci, Natl Engn Lab Hydromet Cleaner Prod Technol, CAS Key Lab Green Proc & Engn, Inst Proc Engn, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Hisatomi, Takashi; Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supramat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Off Univ Prof, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Hu, S (reprint author), Yale Univ, Dept Chem & Environm Engn, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.; Hu, S (reprint author), Yale Univ, Energy Sci Inst, 810 West Campus Dr, West Haven, CT 06516 USA.",shu.hu@yale.edu,,"Domen, Kazunari/0000-0001-7995-4832; Hu, Shu/0000-0002-5041-0169",Tomkat Foundation; Japan Student Services OrganizationJapan Student Services Organization,"The authors would like to thank Dr Min Li at Yale's Materials Characterization Core for his invaluable help with XRD and SEM measurements, Mr Hao Lyu for preparing Al-doped SrTiO<INF>3</INF> particles and Mr Yutaka Sasaki for preparing Ta<INF>3</INF>N<INF>5</INF> thin films.

Smallmouth bass spawning started in early May, when required water temperatures were met, and continued as long as spawning was not disrupted by high water levels. Spawning sites were found in patches throughout the study area that had significantly different physical characteristics than typical stream habitat features. Utilized spawning sites had low current velocity, were relatively shallow, and had pebble-sized substrate. Individual nest variables showed correlation with nesting male size as larger males constructed larger and deeper nests in faster flowing and deeper areas of the river. Nest guarding rates were low while egg presence rates were high compared to the native range, which may indicate that factors such as favorable water levels and water temperature and prevalence of spawning habitat facilitate spawning and the spread of smallmouth bass in the Chikuma River.","[Peterson, Miles, I; Ida, Hideyuki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Educ, Nagano 3808544, Japan; [Kitano, Satoshi] Nagano Environm Conservat Res Inst, Nagano 3810075, Japan","Peterson, MI (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Educ, Nagano 3808544, Japan.",milesipeterson@gmail.com,,,"Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism","thank the Koshoku Fisheries Cooperation for their agreement to allow observation and sampling of fish in the Chikuma River.

Although recent studies have shown that unfolded protein responses (UPRs) play an important role in intracellular remodeling and contribute to skeletal muscle differentiation, the involvement of IRE1-XBP1 signaling, a major UPR signaling pathway, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the IRE1-XBP1 pathway on skeletal muscle differentiation. In C2C12 cells, knockdown of IRE1 and XBP1 in cells remarkably suppressed differentiation. In addition, apoptosis and autophagy were dramatically enhanced in the XBP1-knockdown cells, highlighting the participation of IRE1-XBP1 in cell survival maintenance with differentiation stimuli during skeletal muscle differentiation. In myogenic cells, we demonstrated that the expression of CDK5 (cyclin-dependent kinase 5) is regulated by XBP1s, and we propose that XBP1 regulates the expression of MyoD family genes via the induction of CDK5.

The 15-item ""Values of Younger Ages"" (VOYAGE) scale was developed through a review of previous literature and preliminary examinations of junior high school, high school, and university students. A total of 3085 respondents, comprising 1054 junior high school students (489 boys and 565 girls; mean age = 14.16 years), 1106 high school students (307 boys and 799 girls; mean age = 16.84 years), and 925 undergraduate students (474 boys and 451 girls; mean age = 19.97 years) from Japan, were recruited. Minimum average of the squared partial correlations and factor analysis yielded a two-factor solution (factor 1 = ""Clarification of Value and Commitment"" (CVC); factor 2 = ""Continuation of Avoidance"" (CA)), with the correlation between these factors being - 0.27. CVC and CA had adequate internal consistency values for each participant group (omega coefficient range = 0.78 similar to 0.89) and moderate test-retest reliability. Scale validity was determined via positive relationships with measures of experiential avoidance, environmental reward, fulfillment, and subjective well-being. All items also had high discrimination power, indicating that VOYAGE could be useful for a wide range of young populations. The present scale for assessing values among early-to mid-adolescents aligns well with acceptance and commitment therapy based on psychological flexibility theory.

Thus, reducing energy waste becomes has gained more importance. Thermal insulation materials with superlow thermal conductivity show notable potential in energy saving. Herein, an adiabatic hollow silica/polyacrylonitrile (SiO2-PAN) fibrous nanocomposite membrane was prepared via electrospinning. Hollow SiO2 spheres were prepared by using tetraethyl orthosilicate as a silica source and hydrothermal carbon spheres as the template. The thermal insulation property of PAN fibrous nanocomposite membrane can be enhanced by appending hollow SiO2 spheres. The solid conduction of the fibrous nanocomposite membrane was reduced by the addition of hollow SiO2 spheres. The composite fibrous nanocomposite membrane is flexible and achieves an optimal thermal conductivity of 16 mW/(m.K). The fibrous nanocomposite membrane can maintain its thermal insulation property and becomes hydrophobic after treatment with silicone oil. The developed membrane provides a new idea for the future development of thermal insulation materials.","[Tao, Dongzhi; Li, Xiang; Dong, Yubing; Zhu, Yaofeng; Yuan, Yumin; Fu, Yaqin] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Adv Text Mat & Mfg Technol, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ni, Qingqing] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Fu, Shaoyun] Chongqing Univ, Coll Aerosp Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China","Fu, YQ (reprint author), Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Adv Text Mat & Mfg Technol, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.; Fu, SY (reprint author), Chongqing Univ, Coll Aerosp Engn, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China.",fyq01@zstu.edu.cn; syfu@cqu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Natural Science Foundation of China [51473147],"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (Grant No. 51473147).

Thus far, 41 patients from 28 families with mcEDS-CHST14 and five patients from four families with mcEDS-DSE have been described in the literature. Clinical features comprise multisystem congenital malformations and progressive connective tissue fragility-related manifestations. This review outlines recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of mcEDS. Pathogenic variants in CHST14 or DSE lead to reduced activities of relevant enzymes, resulting in a negligible amount of dermatan sulfate (DS) and an excessive amount of chondroitin sulfate. Connective tissue fragility is presumably attributable to a compositional change in the glycosaminoglycan chains of decorin, a major DS-proteoglycan in the skin that contributes to collagen fibril assembly. Collagen fibrils in affected skin are dispersed in the papillary to reticular dermis, whereas those in normal skin are regularly and tightly assembled. Glycosaminoglycan chains are linear in affected skin, stretching from the outer surface of collagen fibrils to adjacent fibrils; glycosaminoglycan chains are curved in normal skin, maintaining close contact with attached collagen fibrils. Homozygous (Chst14(-/-)) mice have been shown perinatal lethality, shorter fetal length and vessel-related placental abnormalities. Milder phenotypes in mcEDS-DSE might be related to a smaller fraction of decorin DS, potentially through residual DSE activity or compensation by DSE2 activity. These findings suggest critical roles of DS and DS-proteoglycans in the multisystem development and maintenance of connective tissues, and provide fundamental evidence to support future etiology-based therapies.","[Kosho, Tomoki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Genet, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Kosho, Tomoki] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Ctr Med Genet, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Kosho, Tomoki] Res Ctr Supports Adv Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Mizumoto, Shuji; Yamada, Shuhei] Meijo Univ, Dept Pathobiochem, Fac Pharm, Nagoya, Aichi 4688503, Japan; [Watanabe, Takafumi] Rakuno Gakuen Univ, Sch Vet Med, Anat Lab, Ebetsu, Hokkaido 0698501, Japan; [Yoshizawa, Takahiro] Shinshu Univ, Res Ctr Supports Adv Sci, Div Anim Res, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Miyake, Noriko] Yokohama City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Human Genet, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2360004, Japan","Kosho, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med Genet, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Kosho, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Ctr Med Genet, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.; Kosho, T (reprint author), Res Ctr Supports Adv Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",ktomoki@shinshu-u.ac.jp; mizumoto@meijo-u.ac.jp; t-watanabe@rakuno.ac.jp; tyoshizawa@shinshu-u.ac.jp; nmiyake@yokohama-cu.ac.jp; shuheiy@meijo-u.ac.jp,,"Mizumoto, Shuji/0000-0002-4641-1505","Practical Research Project for Rare/Intractable Diseases from the Japan Agency for Medical Research Development (AMED) [105]; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [16K08251, 19K07054, 19K08745, 19H03616, 16K19396]; Research Institute of Meijo University","We thank all the collaborators engaged in this project.

Recently, surgical treatment has been reported as superior to nonsurgical treatment, but the contribution discontinued antiresorptive agent use during MRONJ treatment remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of drug holidays and treatment strategies in MRONJ cases. Four-hundred and twenty-seven patients with MRONJ treated at nine hospitals from 2009 to 2017 were included in this multicenter retrospective study. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the primary disease (osteoporosis or malignant tumor), diabetes, serum albumin, and treatment method (surgical or nonsurgical) were significantly correlated with the cure rate. The cumulative 1-year cure rates in the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups were 64.7% and 18.2%, respectively. However, discontinuing antiresorptive agents did not influence the treatment outcome in the cohort overall, or in 230 patients after performing propensity score matching among the discontinuation and continuation groups. When stratifying by treatment method, antiresorptive agent discontinuation significantly increased the cure rate in patients with osteoporosis who underwent nonsurgical treatment. In patients with malignant tumors undergoing nonsurgical therapy, discontinuing the antiresorptive agent was associated with a better treatment outcome, but not with statistical significance. In contrast, drug holidays showed no effect on improving outcomes in patients with both osteoporosis and malignant tumors who underwent surgical therapy. Thus, regardless of the primary disease, discontinuing antiresorptive agents during treatment for MRONJ may not be necessary and may be helpful in some cases. Future prospective trials should examine this question further.","[Hayashida, Saki; Yanamoto, Souichi; Umeda, Masahiro] Nagasaki Univ Grad Sch BioMed Sciences, Dept Clin Oral Oncology, 1-7-1, Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan; [Fujita, Shigeyuki] Wakayama Med Univ, Dept Oral, Maxillofacial Surg, Wakayama, Wakayama, Japan; [Hasegawa, Takumi; Komori, Takahide] Kobe Univ Grad Sch Med, Dept Oral, Maxillofacial Surg, Kobe, Japan; [Kojima, Yuka] Kansai Med Univ, Dept Dent, Oral Surg, Osaka, Japan; [Miyamoto, Hironori; Shibuya, Yasuyuki] Nagoya City Univ Grad Sch Med Sciences, Dept Oral, Maxillofacial Surg, Nagoya, Japan; [Ueda, Nobuhiro; Kirita, Tadaaki] Nara Med Univ, Dept Oral, Maxillofacial Surg, Kashihara, Japan; [Nakahara, Hirokazu] Osaka City Univ Grad Sch Med, Dept Dent, Oral Surg, Osaka, Japan; [Shinohara, Mitsuyo] Juntendo Univ, Fac Med, Dept Oral, Maxillofacial Surg, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan; [Kondo, Eiji; Kurita, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Dent, Oral Surg, Matsumoto, Japan","Hayashida, S (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ Grad Sch BioMed Sciences, Dept Clin Oral Oncology, 1-7-1, Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan.",sakihaya@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Yanamoto, Souichi/0000-0003-2372-8347",,,,24,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0914-8779,1435-5604,,J BONE MINER METAB,J.

Leaning events are recorded by reaction wood formation in tree rings, and it remains unclear what soil conditions are required for reaction wood formation of drunken trees. Tree disk morphology and soil hummock properties were examined for fifty tree-mound combinations in Northwest Territories, Canada. Spruce trees growing on mound edges form reaction wood on the downslope sides of their trunks. Reaction wood formation in mature trees was greatest in stem tissues between ground level and 30 cm aboveground. Reaction wood formation occurred only in trees growing on mound edges. The extent of reaction wood formation was higher in trees growing in clayey soils than in trees on sandy soils. For trees growing on clayey mound edges, the extent of reaction wood formation decreased with increasing permafrost table depth. Black spruce tree rings formed between ground level and 30 cm aboveground could record movement of clayey soil hummocks over shallow, underlying permafrost tables. A combination of clayey soil texture and shallow permafrost table is likely required for development of hummocks and drunken forests on the continuous permafrost region studied.","[Fujii, Kazumichi; Matsuura, Yojiro] Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Div Forest Soils, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan; [Yasue, Koh] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Ina, Saitama, Japan; [Osawa, Akira] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Agr, Kyoto, Japan","Fujii, K (reprint author), Forestry & Forest Prod Res Inst, Div Forest Soils, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058687, Japan.",fkazumichi@affrc.go.jp,,,"Green Network of Excellence (GRENE) Arctic Climate Change Project; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17K15292]",This work was financially supported by the Green Network of Excellence (GRENE) Arctic Climate Change Project and by a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) grant (No. 17K15292).,,27,0,0,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1523-0430,1938-4246,,ARCT ANTARCT ALP RES,Arct.

In this work, NH2-C was successfully synthesized from a mixture of phenol and (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) through solution plasma processing, which performs both carbonization and amination simultaneously. This synthesis method eliminates the need to functionalize carbon with amino groups, as is required in the conventional process. Our NH2-C shows a better dispersion and a higher number of amino groups on both the external surface and inner pores, which enhances the adsorption capacity. The maximum capacities for Cu2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ adsorption were 144.9, 115.4, and 102.0 mg g(-1), respectively. These values were higher than those of five typical NH2-Cs synthesized by a conventional process. Based on the adsorption mechanism derived from adsorption kinetic, isotherm, and thermodynamic studies, the transition metal ions were chemisorbed to the surface in a monolayer endothermically and spontaneously. Moreover, it was found that NH2-C was suitable for use in ten consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles without significant loss of adsorption capacity.","[Tipplook, Mongkol; Pornaroontham, Phuwadej; Saito, Nagahiro] Nagoya Univ, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Grad Sch Engn, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Saito, Nagahiro] Nagoya Univ, Inst Mat Innovat, Inst Innovat Future Soc, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Saito, Nagahiro] Shinshu Univ, Conjoint Res Lab Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Pornaroontham, Phuwadej; Saito, Nagahiro] Res Inst & Academia OPERA, Japan Sci & Technol Corp JST, Open Innovat Platform Enterprises, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Saito, Nagahiro] Japan Sci & Technol Corp JST, Strateg Int Collaborat Res Program SICORP, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan; [Watthanaphanit, Anyarat] Mahidol Univ, Dept Chem, Fac Sci, Salaya 73170, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand","Saito, N (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Grad Sch Engn, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.; Saito, N (reprint author), Nagoya Univ, Inst Mat Innovat, Inst Innovat Future Soc, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.; Saito, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Conjoint Res Lab Nagoya Univ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.; Saito, N (reprint author), Res Inst & Academia OPERA, Japan Sci & Technol Corp JST, Open Innovat Platform Enterprises, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.; Saito, N (reprint author), Japan Sci & Technol Corp JST, Strateg Int Collaborat Res Program SICORP, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648603, Japan.",hiro@sp.material.nagoya-u.ac.jp,"; Saito, Nagahiro/I-6113-2014","Watthanaphanit, Anyarat/0000-0002-3649-7456; Saito, Nagahiro/0000-0001-8757-3933",JST-SICORP Grant [JPMJSC18H1]; JST-OPERA Grant [JPMJOP1843],This work was supported by JST-SICORP Grant JPMJSC18H1 and JST-OPERA Grant JPMJOP1843.,,40,0,0,2,2,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2574-0970,,,ACS APPL NANO MATER,ACS Appl.

OsHKT1;1 in japonica rice (Nipponbare) produces mRNA variants, but their functions remain elusive. In salt tolerant rice, Pokkali, eight OsHKT1;1 variants (V1-V8) were identified in addition to the full-length OsHKT1;1 (FL) cDNA. Absolute quantification by qPCR revealed that accumulation of OsHKT1;1-FL mRNA is minor in contrast to that of OsHKT1;1-V1, -V2, -V4, and -V7 mRNAs, all of which are predominant in shoots, while only V1 and V7 mRNAs are predominant in roots. Two electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) experiments using Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that oocytes-expressing OsHKT1;1-FL from Pokkali exhibited inward-rectified currents in the presence of 96 mM Na+ as reported previously. Further TEVC analyses indicated that six of eight OsHKT1;1 variants elicited currents in a Na+ or a K+ bath solution. OsHKT1;1-V6 exhibited a similar inward rectification to the FL protein. Contrastingly, however, the rests mediated bidirectional currents in both Na+ and K+ bath solutions. These data suggest possibilities that novel mechanisms regulating the transport activity of OsHKT1;1 might exist, and that OsHKT1;1 variants might also carry out distinct physiological roles either independently or in combination with OsHKT1;1-FL.","[Imran, Shahin; Katsuhara, Maki] Okayama Univ, Inst Plant Sci & Resources, 2-20-1 Chuo, Kurashiki, Okayama 7100046, Japan; [Horie, Tomoaki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Div Appl Biol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Katsuhara, M (reprint author), Okayama Univ, Inst Plant Sci & Resources, 2-20-1 Chuo, Kurashiki, Okayama 7100046, Japan.; Horie, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Div Appl Biol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",ptj87a5q@s.okayama-u.ac.jp; horie@shinshu-u.ac.jp; kmaki@okayama-u.ac.jp,,"Imran, Shahin/0000-0002-7423-9984","Ohara Foundation for Agricultural Science; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as part of the Joint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University in Japan [2918, 3019]","This work was supported by Ohara Foundation for Agricultural Science, (to M.K.), and by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) as part of the Joint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University in Japan (2918, 3019 to T.H.).",,35,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2223-7747,,PLANTS-BASEL,Plants-Basel,JAN,2020,9,1,,,,,,,16,10.3390/plants9010016,,,12,Plant Sciences,Plant Sciences,KL2DE,WOS:000513238700016,31877741,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

We propose novel methodology, which can completely resolve this problem; namely, flame is extinguished by ""a vacuuming operation"" driven by the pressure difference between the suction box and the cabin, whereby toxic gases and even the fire source is drawn into the box, where an effective extinguishment procedure can be separately operated. To convince the effectiveness of this methodology and investigate its performance, a specially-designed test device is developed and an extinction test is examined in this paper. The main experimental parameters are the suction flow rate and the distance between the end of the suction pipe and the burning specimen. The burning specimen used in this study is a small scale electric wire with a polymer sheath. The extinction process via suction operation has been observed carefully. In addition to the direct observation, velocity measurement induced by suction operation as well as the use of the Schlieren imaging technique are introduced. It is found that the vacuuming extinction can be categorized into three types based on the mechanism leading to the extinction. The model of the extinction procedure is proposed and corresponding three non-dimensional numbers as a function of vacuuming volume flow rate (Q) are developed to predict the mode on vacuuming extinction. Afterall, this paper successfully show the concept of a vacuum extinction and how it works.","[Nakamura, Yuji] Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tempaku Ku, 1-1 Hibarigaoka, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan; [Usuki, Taichi] Hokkaido Univ, Kita Ku, N13-W8, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608628, Japan; [Wakatsuki, Kaoru] Shinshu Univ, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Nakamura, Y (reprint author), Toyohashi Univ Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Tempaku Ku, 1-1 Hibarigaoka, Toyohashi, Aichi 4418580, Japan.",yuji@me.tut.ac.jp,,,,,,20,1,1,0,0,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0015-2684,1572-8099,,FIRE TECHNOL,Fire Technol.,JAN,2020,56,1,,,SI,,361,384,,10.1007/s10694-019-00854-4,,,24,"Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Engineering; Materials Science,KJ5CI,WOS:000512076800017,,,,,2020/4/20

The PEC activity is determined by the charge separation; hence, the behaviors of charge carriers at the junctions should be elucidated. However, it has been quite challenging since the distinction of carriers located in different layers has been extremely hard. In this work, we succeeded in the identification of the individual electron- and hole-transfer kinetics at CoOx/BiVO4/SnO2 double heterojunctions by measuring transient absorption (TA) from the visible to mid-IR region: we found that the absorption peaks of electrons and holes depend on the materials. From the change in spectral shape after the selective photoexcitation of BiVO4, it was confirmed that electrons excited in the BiVO4 rapidly transferred to the SnO2 layer after similar to 3 ps, but the holes remained in the BiVO4 and further transferred to CoOx in a few picoseconds. As a result, recombination of charge carriers was suppressed and 2.4 and 3.6 times a large amount of carriers are surviving at 5 mu s on BiVO4/SnO2 and CoOx/BiVO4/SnO2, respectively, compared to bare BiVO4. For such picosecond-rapid and effective charge separation, the previously well proposed sole intralayer or interlayer charge separation mechanism is not enough. Hence the synergetic effect of these two mechanisms, the band-bending-assisted charge transfer across the heterojunction, is proposed. The enhanced PEC activity of CoOx/BiVO4/SnO2 electrodes was reasonably explained by this synergistic charge separation kinetics. This fundamental knowledge of charge carrier dynamics will be beneficial for the design of superior solar energy conversion systems.","[Yamakata, Akira; Ranasinghe, Chandana Sampath Kumara; Hayashi, Naruki; Kato, Kosaku; Vequizo, Junie Jhon M.] Toyota Technol Inst, Grad Sch Engn, Tempa Ku, 2-12-1 Hisakata, Nagoya, Aichi 4688511, Japan; [Yamakata, Akira] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Catalysis, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan; [Vequizo, Junie Jhon M.] Shinshu Univ, RISM, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Yamakata, A (reprint author), Toyota Technol Inst, Grad Sch Engn, Tempa Ku, 2-12-1 Hisakata, Nagoya, Aichi 4688511, Japan.; Yamakata, A (reprint author), Hokkaido Univ, Inst Catalysis, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0010021, Japan.",yamakata@toyota-ti.ac.jp,"Yamakata, Akira/I-6260-2013","Yamakata, Akira/0000-0003-3179-7588","Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Mixed Anion) [17H05491, 19H04708]; Strategic Research Infrastructure Project of MEXT; Cooperative Research Program of Institute for Catalysis, Hokkaido University [17A1001];  [16H04188];  [19H02820]","This work was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Basic Research (B) (Grant Nos. 16H04188 and 19H02820), Scientific Research on Innovative Areas (Mixed Anion; Grant Nos. 17H05491 and 19H04708), the Strategic Research Infrastructure Project of MEXT, and Cooperative Research Program of Institute for Catalysis, Hokkaido University (Grant No. 17A1001).

Uniaxial compression, diagonal compression and bending tests were performed. The specimens strengthened with timber and steel members were also tested. The tests showed that the masonry specimens had fair strength in compression, shear and tension. The strengthening with timber and steel members successfully increased the strength and stiffness of the specimens.

The current practice for grading oil palm fruit bunches in mills is using human graders for visual inspection, which can lead to repeated mistakes, inconsistent evaluation results, and many other related losses. This study aims to develop a fruit maturity sensor that can detect oil palm fruit maturity grade and send indication to the user whether to accept or reject the bunches. This study focuses on fruit battery principle and applying the charging concept to the fruit battery in order to generate significant load voltage readings of oil palm fruit battery. The charging process resulted in amplified load voltage readings, which were 4 times more sensitive to changes as compared to normal fruit battery without charging process. From the load voltage readings, the fruits can be characterized into their maturity grade based on moisture content. It was determined that fruits with moisture content less than 44% and average load voltage, V-avg, between 20 to 30 mV are considered ripe fruits.","[Misron, Norhisam; Azhar, Nisa Syakirah Kamal; Hamidon, Mohd Nizar; Aris, Ishak] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Misron, Norhisam; Hamidon, Mohd Nizar] Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Adv Technol ITMA, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Tashiro, Kunihisa] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Nagata, Hirokazu] Shinshu Univ, Ctr Global Educ & Collaborat, Nagano, Japan","Misron, N; Azhar, NSK (reprint author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Engn, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.; Misron, N (reprint author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Inst Adv Technol ITMA, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",norhisam@upm.edu.my; nsyakeerah@yahoo.com; mnh@upm.edu.my; ishak_ar@upm.edu.my; tashiro@shinshu-u.ac.jp; hnagata@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Kunihisa, Tashiro/AAG-1609-2020","Kunihisa, Tashiro/0000-0003-0793-882X; Hamidon, Mohd Nizar/0000-0001-9189-4465; Aris, Ishak Bin/0000-0003-0864-8656","Ministry of Education, MalaysiaMinistry of Education, Malaysia [TR@M]","This work is funded by the Ministry of Education, Malaysia for financial support under the ""Translational Research"" Grant (TR@M).",,20,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-8220,,SENSORS-BASEL,Sensors,JAN,2020,20,1,,,,,,,226,10.3390/s20010226,,,14,"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation",Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation,KH2QT,WOS:000510493100226,31906081,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

L cells, identified using GLP-1 immunohistochemistry, are open-type endocrine cells that are distributed in the jejunum and ileum of chickens. GLP-1 co-localizes with GLP-2 and neurotensin in the same cells of the chicken ileum. Intestinal L cells secrete GLP-1 in response to food ingestion. Proteins and amino acids, such as lysine and methionine, in the diet trigger GLP-1 secretion from the chicken intestinal L cells. The receptor that specifically binds chicken GLP-1 is expressed in pancreatic D cells, implying that the physiological functions of chicken GLP-1 differ from its functions as an incretin in mammals.","[Hiramatsu, Kohzy] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, LAFA, Minami Minowa 8304, Kami Ina, Nagano 3994598, Japan","Hiramatsu, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, LAFA, Minami Minowa 8304, Kami Ina, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",seitaik@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,Japan Poultry Science Association,"The author sthank Dr. Takafumi Watanabe, Rakunogakuen University, and Dr. Kei Nishimura for their scientific supports.

To aid in developing a chemical recycling method without the evolution of harmful hydrochloric acid (HCI) and organochlorines, we have proposed a dehydrochlorination process at a low temperature (around 423 K) using zinc(II) oxide (ZnO). ZnO particles dispersed into the polymer matrix were found to be effective for thorough dehydrochlorination because the reaction promoters (zinc chloride [ZnCl2] and water) spontaneously penetrated the polymer via exothermic reactions. As a result, only a small percentage of chlorine atoms remained with a low amount of HCI. The efficiency of dehydrochlorination was a result of increasing the contact area with ZnO particles using a heat-kneading apparatus. The catalyst ZnCl2 was involved in the cross-linking reaction to form C-C single bond. Due to exothermic reaction, the scission or isomerization to polyene and aromatics also proceeded over a short period, leading to a microporous carbonaceous solid with a surface area of 5 x 10(2) m(2)/g.

For basal slip, extended dislocations were generated and then glided on the basal planes, irrespective of the applied normal stress conditions as well as the adopted interatomic potentials. On the other hand, in simulations for first-pyramidal slip, distinct gliding of a dislocation was not observed, and alternatively the shear deformation was mediated by {1 (1) over bar 01} twinning. The deformation behaviors observed in simulations for prismatic slip depended on the applied normal stress as well as the interatomic potential.

We sought to assess clinical outcomes after deferral of revascularization based on FFR. Methods: The J-CONFIRM registry (Long-Term Outcomes of Japanese Patients With Deferral of Coronary Intervention Based on Fractional Flow Reserve in Multicenter Registry) prospectively enrolled 1263 patients with 1447 lesions in whom revascularization was deferred based on FFR at 28 Japanese centers. The primary study end point was the cumulative 2-year incidence of target vessel failure, including cardiac death, target-vessel related myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Results: The mean FFR was 0.86 +/- 0.06. At 2 years, the target vessel failure rate was 5.5% in deferred lesions, mainly driven by a high rate of clinically driven target vessel revascularization (5.2%), and significantly increased with decreasing FFR, especially in the proximal location. Cardiac death and target-vessel related myocardial infarction rarely occurred during the 2-year follow-up (0.41% and 0.41%, respectively). Independent predictors of 2-year target vessel failure were FFR value (per 0.01 decrease; hazard ratio [HR] 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11], P<0.001), left main coronary artery lesion (HR, 5.89 [95% CI, 2.72-12.8], P<0.001), moderately to severely calcified lesion (HR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.36-4.58]; P=0.003), hemodialysis (HR, 2.90 [95% CI, 1.11-7.58]; P=0.03), and right coronary artery lesion (HR, 1.78 [95% CI, 1.02-3.11], P=0.042). Conclusions: The J-CONFIRM registry demonstrated the 2-year target vessel failure rate was 5.5% in deferred lesions, highlighting the safety of FFR-based deferral of revascularization in daily practice.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to clarify the association of various prognostic indices, including the ILD-GAP index, with the prognosis, the incidence of acute exacerbations of ILD (ILD-AE), and the use of long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) after surgery in surgically resected patients with ILD and concomitant lung cancer, to provide additional information when considering whether it is safe to perform surgery. Methods: The medical records of patients with ILD and concomitant lung cancer who had undergone surgery at Shinshu University Hospital between August 2001 and September 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: There were significant differences in survival between the ILD-GAP index: 0-1 and >= 4 groups (p = 0.0001) and between the ILD-GAP index: 2-3 and >= 4 groups (p = 0.0236). A higher ILD-GAP index was independently associated with the risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32030; p = 0.0059). A higher body mass index (BMI) and a higher serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level were independently associated with the incidence of ILD-AE (HR 1.28336; p = 0.0206 and HR 26.3943; p = 0.0165, respectively). A higher severity of ILD on chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was independently associated with the use of LTOT (HR 2.78670; p = 0.0313). Conclusions: The ILD-GAP index can predict the prognosis in surgically resected patients with ILD and concomitant lung cancer. The BMI and serum CRP levels were independent determinants that predicted the incidence of ILD-AE. The severity of ILD on chest HRCT was an independent determinant that predicted the use of LTOT.","[Ueno, Fumika; Kitaguchi, Yoshiaki; Yasuo, Masanori; Wada, Yosuke; Kinjo, Takumi; Hanaoka, Masayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Shiina, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Surg 2, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Asaka, Shiho] Shinshu Univ, Dept Lab Med, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yoshizawa, Akihiko] Kyoto Univ Hosp, Dept Diagnost Pathol, Kyoto, Japan","Kitaguchi, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",kitaguti@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Kitaguchi, Yoshiaki/0000-0002-3922-4082",,,,37,0,0,0,0,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0025-7931,1423-0356,,RESPIRATION,Respiration,JAN,2020,99,1,,,,,9,18,,10.1159/000502849,,,10,Respiratory System,Respiratory System,KD1OM,WOS:000507641800002,31554007,,,,2020/4/20

However, the preparation of BaTaO2N crystals with low defect densities and high crystallinities is challenging via ammonolysis at high temperatures. Thus, we herein report the preparation of BaTaO2N crystals using an NH3-assisted flux method. We initially studied the effects of the flux type (RbCl, CsCl, and BaCl2 center dot 2H(2)O) on the morphology, crystallinity, and photo-NH3 catalytic performance of the BaTaO2N crystals. It was found that the BaTaO2N crystals grown using a RbCl flux exhibited a significantly higher photocatalytic H-2 evolution rate than those grown using the other two fluxes. In particular, the observed activity was almost twice as high as that reported over BaTaO2N crystals grown using a KCl flux. Such an excellent activity could be attributed to the lower defect density and higher crystallinity, which were confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and composition analysis. Subsequently, the effects of the source ratio, solute concentration, reaction temperature, and time on the crystallinity and morphology of the BaTaO2N crystals grown using a RbCl flux were studied systematically to gain insight into the BaTaO2N crystal growth mechanism.","[Luo, Ying] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Dept Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Wang, Zheng; Hisatomi, Takashi; Domen, Kazunari; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Suzuki, Sayaka; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Yubuta, Kunio] Tohoku Univ, Inst Mat Res, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Kariya, Nobuko] Mitsubishi Chem Corp, Sci & Innovat Ctr, Aoba Ku, 1000 Kamoshida Cho, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2278502, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Off Univ Prof, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Domen, K; Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Domen, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Off Univ Prof, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan.",domen@chemsys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; teshima@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Yubuta, Kunio/B-8124-2011; Suzuki, Sayaka/B-3486-2018","Yubuta, Kunio/0000-0002-3401-6874; Suzuki, Sayaka/0000-0002-0186-1959; Domen, Kazunari/0000-0001-7995-4832",Artificial Photosynthesis Project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO),This work was supported by the Artificial Photosynthesis Project of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).,,29,0,0,17,17,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1528-7483,1528-7505,,CRYST GROWTH DES,Cryst.

We also evaluated to what extent the overall image quality was improved by adding BH-MRCP to RG-MRCP. Materials and Methods: A total of 113 patients who underwent RG-MRCP and BH-MRCP at a 3-T MR unit were enrolled. We set a scan time of approximately 180 s for RG-MRCP and 20 s for BH-MRCP before examination, and measured actual scan time and assessed image quality using a 5-point scale (5, good; 1, poor). Image quality scores of 1, 2 and 3 were considered clinically inadequate. Image quality scores of RG-MRCP and BH-MRCP were compared. In addition, we compared ""RG-MRCP alone"" and ""hybrid MRCP"" (the best-scoring image was picked from RG-MRCP and BH-MRCP when the RG-MRCP score was clinically inadequate). Results: The mean actual scan time of RG-MRCP/BH-MRCP was 191/20 s. The mean scores of RG-MRCP, BHMRCP and hybrid MRCP were 3.67, 3.35 and 3.92, respectively. The score of hybrid MRCP was significantly better than that of RG-MRCP (P < 0.05). The image quality of RG-MRCP was clinically inadequate in 43/113 (38 %) cases and the inadequate image quality was improved to be clinically adequate in 13/43 (30 %) cases by adding BH-MRCP. Conclusion: BH-MRCP brings added value to RG-MRCP because an additional examination of BH-MRCP could compensate for the image deterioration of RG-MRCP caused by motion artifacts.","[Tokoro, Hirokazu; Yamada, Akira; Suzuki, Takeshi; Fujinaga, Yasunari] Shinshu Univ, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Kito, Yoshihiro; Adachi, Yasuo; Hayashihara, Hayato] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Radiol Div, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Nickel, Marcel D.] Siemens Healthcare GmbH, MR Applicat Predev, Erlangen, Germany; [Maruyama, Katsuya] Siemens Healthcare KK, MR Res & Collaborat Dept, Tokyo, Japan","Fujinaga, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",fujinaga@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Yamada, Akira/AAD-1536-2019; Fujinaga, Yasunari/AAC-7635-2020","Yamada, Akira/0000-0002-4199-203X; Fujinaga, Yasunari/0000-0002-3752-257X",,,,14,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0720-048X,1872-7727,,EUR J RADIOL,Eur.

Staged angioplasty (SAP)-i.e., angioplasty followed by delayed CAS-has been reported as a potential CHS-avoiding procedure. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effectiveness of SAP in avoiding CHS after carotid revascularization for patients at high risk for this complication. METHODS The authors retrospectively studied cases involving patients at high risk for CHS from 44 Japanese centers who were scheduled for SAP, regular CAS, angioplasty, or staged procedures other than SAP between October 2007 and March 2014. They investigated the rate of CHS in the population scheduled for SAP or regular CAS, and for safety analysis, the composite rate of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke in the population eventually receiving SAP or regular CAS. RESULTS Data from a total of 525 patients (532 lesions, mean age 72.5 +/- 7.5 years, 74 women) were analyzed. Scheduled procedures included SAP for 113 lesions and regular CAS for 419 lesions. The rate of CHS was lower in the SAP group than in the regular CAS group (4.4% vs 10.5%, p = 0.047). Multivariate analysis showed that SAP was negatively related to CHS (OR 0.315; 95% CI 0.120-0.828). In the population eventually receiving SAP (102 lesions) or regular CAS (428 lesions), the composite rate of TIA and ischemic stroke was comparable between the SAP group and the regular CAS group (9.8% vs 9.3%). CONCLUSIONS SAP may be an effective and safe carotid revascularization procedure to avoid CHS.","[Hayakawa, Mikito; Fukuda-Doi, Mayumi] Natl Cerebral & Cardiovasc Ctr, Dept Cerebrovasc Med, Suita, Osaka, Japan;

METHODS From 2008 to 2017, 10 patients with pontine cavernous malformations underwent total resection via the trans-fourth ventricle floor approach with FMEP monitoring. House-Brackmann grades and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores were obtained pre- and postoperatively. The surgeries were performed using one of 2 safe entry zones into the brainstem: the suprafacial triangle and infrafacial triangle approaches. Six patients underwent the suprafacial triangle approach, and 4 patients underwent the infrafacial triangle approach. A cranial peg screw electrode was used to deliver electrical stimulation for FMEP by a train of 4 or 5 pulse anodal constant current stimulation. FMEP was recorded from needle electrodes on the ipsilateral facial muscles and monitored throughout surgery by using a threshold-level stimulation method. RESULTS FMEPs were recorded and analyzed in 8 patients; they were not recorded in 2 patients who had severe preoperative facial palsy and underwent an infrafacial triangle approach. Warning signs appeared in all patients who underwent the suprafacial triangle approach. However, after temporarily stopping the procedures, FMEP findings during surgery showed recovery of the thresholds. FMEPs in patients who underwent the infrafacial triangle approach were stable during the surgery. House-Brackmann grades were unchanged postoperatively in all patients. Postoperative KPS scores improved in 3 patients, decreased in 1, and remained the same in 6 patients. CONCLUSIONS FMEPs can be used to monitor facial nerve function during surgery for pontine cavernous malformations, especially when the suprafacial triangle approach is performed.","[Hardian, Ridzky Firmansyah; Goto, Tetsuya; Fujii, Yu; Kanaya, Kohei; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Goto, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",tegotou@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,18,1,1,1,1,AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS,ROLLING MEADOWS,"5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA",0022-3085,1933-0693,,J NEUROSURG,J.

METHODS: We asked 94 core hospitals providing training programs in the board certification system adopted by the Japan Neurosurgical Society to indicate the total number and present status of women in their department and to send our anonymous questionnaire to women who had formerly worked as full-time neurosurgeons. The questionnaire consisted of closed and open questions on their reasons for quitting as full-time neurosurgeons. RESULTS: Among 427 women evaluated, 72 (17%) had quit full-time employment as neurosurgeons. Twenty-one women who had quit 3-21 years after starting their neurosurgery careers responded to the questionnaire, including 17 board-certified neurosurgeons, 11 individuals with master's degrees, and 16 mothers. Their main reasons for quitting full-time work were difficulty in balancing their neurosurgical career and motherhood (52%) and the physical burden (38%). At the time of quitting, only 2 units (5%) had a career counseling system for women. Two thirds of participants might resume full-time work as neurosurgeons in the future. Their support system during pregnancy and the child-raising period, and understanding of male bosses and colleagues were identified as the key themes. CONCLUSIONS: The Japan Neurosurgical Society could facilitate supportive environments for women in neurosurgery by enhancing adequate childcare services, changing the work style of full-time neurosurgeons to incorporate diverse working styles, shorter working hours, understanding of their bosses and colleagues, and a career counseling system.","[Maehara, Taketoshi; Tamura, Kaoru; Sumita, Kazutaka; Hara, Shoko] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kamiya, Kazuko] Japan Med Assoc Res Inst, Tokyo, Japan; [Fujimaki, Takamitsu] Saitama Med Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Hidaka City, Saitama, Japan; [Matsumura, Akira] Univ Tsukuba, Dept Neurosurg, Fac Med, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Hongo, Kazuhiro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kuroda, Satoshi] Univ Toyama, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Neurosurg, Toyama, Japan; [Matsumae, Mitsunori] Tokai Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg, Isehara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Takeshima, Hideo] Miyazaki Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, Japan; [Sugo, Nobuo] Toho Univ, Sch Med, Dept Neurosurg Omori, Ota Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakao, Naoyuki] Wakayama Med Univ, Dept Neurol Surg, Wakayama, Japan; [Saito, Nobuhito] Univ Tokyo, Dept Neurol Surg, Tokyo, Japan; [Ikawa, Fusao] Shimane Prefectural Cent Hosp, Dept Neurol Surg, Izumo, Shimane, Japan; [Tamura, Noriko] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Dept Neurol Surg, Kawadacho, Tokyo, Japan; [Sakurada, Kaori] Yamagata Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurosurg, Yamagata, Yamagata, Japan; [Shimokawa, Shoko] Saga Univ, Fac Med, Dept Neurosurg, Saga, Saga, Japan; [Arai, Hajime] Juntendo Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kato, Yoko] Fujita Hlth Univ, BANTANE Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Nakagawa Ward, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Maehara, T (reprint author), Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",maehara.nsrg@tmd.ac.jp,,,,,,34,0,0,4,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1878-8750,1878-8769,,WORLD NEUROSURG,World Neurosurg.,JAN,2020,133,,,,,,331,342,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.08.045,,,12,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,JX8QN,WOS:000503993700042,31437517,Bronze,,,2020/4/20

Each PEVA-B10 (PEVA with 10 wt% BPO) sample had optimal actuation performance and an excellent recovery ratio of over 99%. The BPO crosslinker played an important role in allowing the samples to return to their original shape, and the samples (PEVA/BPO soft materials) with high crosslinking densities had significantly improved recovery ratios. As a result, the developed PEVA/BPO materials were adequately soft and had good mechanical properties, even at large deformation.

Previous studies have suggested that microbial phosphatase production is regulated by soil nutrient stoichiometry and, thus, promoted by carbon and nitrogen (CN) amendment. However, the mechanism leading to increased phosphatase activity after nutrient amendment to soil is unclear, and it is not known how long the effect of the nutrient amendment lasts. To address these questions, we performed a 24-day time-series analysis of full-factorial soil microcosms with CN amendment. Phosphatase activity as well as that expressed per unit of beta-D-glucosidase activity, increased sharply and significantly in response to the CN amendment. This suggests that the microbial community shifted their resource allocation after the nutrient amendment and preferentially produced phosphatases rather than beta-D-glucosidase. This shifted resource allocation pattern was maintained throughout the 24-day incubation period, and copiotrophic microbes dominated soils that received CN amendment. These results indicate that the effect of the CN amendment on soil microbial resource allocation lasted for > 24 days. Together, our results highlight the importance of high-resolution time-series observations that complement long-term studies for which frequent observation is often difficult.","[Mise, Kazumori; Senoo, Keishi; Otsuka, Shigeto] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Mise, Kazumori] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Sci, Dept Biol Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1130032, Japan; [Maruyama, Runa; Kunito, Takashi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Environm Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Miyabara, Yuichi] Shinshu Univ, Inst Mt Sci, 5-2-4 Kogandori, Suwa 3920027, Japan; [Senoo, Keishi; Otsuka, Shigeto] Univ Tokyo, Collaborat Res Inst Innovat Microbiol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan","Mise, K (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Dept Appl Biol Chem, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",mise-33@bs.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp,"Kunito, Takashi/D-8449-2012","Kunito, Takashi/0000-0002-3028-736X; Mise, Kazumori/0000-0003-3565-3119","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26292035]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [Grant Number 26292035].

However, concentrated micropollutants in feed solutions still pose a high risk to environments and may contaminate the permeate. Here, a proof-of-concept of enzyme-aided forward osmosis (E-FO) process was demonstrated. In E-FO process, degradation and rejection of micropollutants occurred simultaneously, providing a detoxified feed solution and a cleaner permeate. A lab-made polyketone-based thin film composite membrane with high flux and high micropollutants rejection was explored as FO membrane. Laccase and 2, 4, 6-trichlorophenol (TCP) was employed as a model enzyme and micropollutant, respectively. Compared with a single enzyme catalysis, E-FO process showed a higher degradation efficiency owing to enzyme condensation during filtration. Compared with a single FO process including 0.051 mM TCP in feed solution, E-FO process adding 0.8 mu M laccase showed 7.4 and 10.7 times lower TCP permeation and membrane adsorption when operated for 10 h. An enzyme-aided reverse osmosis (E-RO) process can produce clean water with similar quality as that of E-FO, however, suffers from membrane fouling. This work provides an insight in facile coupling of efficient enzyme catalysis with low fouling FO process for high quality water production from contaminated water resources.","[Liu, Cuijing; Takagi, Ryosuke; Cheng, Liang; Matsuyama, Hideto] Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Membrane & Film Technol, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Saeki, Daisuke] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Matsuyama, H (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Res Ctr Membrane & Film Technol, Dept Chem Sci & Engn, Nada Ku, 1-1 Rokkodai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",matuyama@kobe-u.ac.jp,"Matsuyama, Hideto/G-2357-2016","Matsuyama, Hideto/0000-0003-2468-4905","Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Creation of Innovation Centers for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Areas Program (Innovative Bioproduction, Kobe) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan; China Scholarship Council (CSC)China Scholarship Council [201808050149]","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support through the Grants-in-Aid from the Special Coordination Funds for Promoting Science and Technology, and the Creation of Innovation Centers for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research Areas Program (Innovative Bioproduction, Kobe) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan.

Case presentation: A 73-year-old female was clinically diagnosed with a NMOSD based on the clinical and radiological features and positive serum autoantibodies to AQP4. One month before her death, she became acutely ill with disturbed consciousness and right hemiparesis, and was diagnosed and treated as having basal ganglia infarction based on the brain CT. She made a partial recovery but later died from heart failure. At autopsy, the corresponding basal ganglia process revealed a large fresh area of necrosis. Histologically, several pathological signatures of NMOSD could be recognized in the lesion, including inflammatory cell infiltrations by B and T lymphocytes, perivascular complement and fibrinogen deposition, and the appearance of numerous phagocytosed corpora amylacea within the infiltrating macrophages. Conclusions: The present case illustrates that basal ganglia may be directly involved in the pathological processes of NMOSD, although the possibility of modification of the lesions by superimposed regional ischemia could not be excluded.","[Ohara, Shinji; Miyahira, Taka-aki; Oguchi, Kenya; Takei, Yo-ichi] Matsumoto Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Minami 2-20-30, Matsumoto, Nagano 3998701, Japan; [Ohara, Shinji] Iida Hosp, Dept Neurol, 1-15 Ohdori, Iida 3958505, Japan; [Yanagimura, Fumihiro; Kawachi, Izumi] Niigata Univ, Brain Res Inst, Dept Neurol, Niigata, Japan; [Oyanagi, Kiyomitsu] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Brain Res Ctr, Div Neuropathol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Oyanagi, Kiyomitsu] Hatsuishi Hosp, Brain Res Lab, Chiba, Japan; [Kakita, Akiyoshi] Niigata Univ, Brain Res Inst, Dept Neuropathol, Niigata, Japan","Ohara, S (reprint author), Matsumoto Med Ctr, Dept Neurol, Minami 2-20-30, Matsumoto, Nagano 3998701, Japan.; Ohara, S (reprint author), Iida Hosp, Dept Neurol, 1-15 Ohdori, Iida 3958505, Japan.",shinji.ohara@iida.or.jp,,,,,,14,0,0,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2377,,BMC NEUROL,BMC Neurol.,30-Dec,2019,19,1,,,,,,,351,10.1186/s12883-019-1580-3,,,6,Clinical Neurology,Neurosciences & Neurology,KG1YK,WOS:000509737700004,31888527,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

Materials and Methods Serum specimens were collected from 1,024 Japanese children (426 boys and 598 girls) in 2013. The median age at diagnosis was 7 years (0-18 years). The blood specimens were obtained at a median age of 13 years (2-22 years). Results Among the 628 children whose serum specimens were collected within 5 years after diagnosis, the rate of GADAb positivity was 47.9% using RIA and 69.4% using ELISA. The participants were divided into four groups according to their RIA and ELISA results for GADAb as follows: group I (RIA+/ELISA+), group II (RIA+/ELISA-), group III (RIA-/ELISA+) and group IV (RIA-/ELISA-). The clinical and genetic characteristics of group I and group III were quite similar in terms of age at diagnosis, male/female ratio, relatively high positive rates for both autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 and autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8, and human leukocyte antigen genotype. Group II contained just five patients, and was characterized by a younger age at diagnosis, low positive rates for both autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 and autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8, and a unique human leukocyte antigen genotype. If the positive rates of either autoantibody to protein tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 or autoantibody to the cation efflux transporter zinc transporter 8 or both were added to the GADAb results using RIA, the percentage of autoimmune type 1 diabetes increased from 47.9% to 78.5%. Conclusions The diagnosis of autoimmune childhood-onset Japanese type 1 diabetes increased when GADAb results were obtained using a new ELISA method, compared with a previously utilized RIA method.","[Sugihara, Shigetaka] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Med Ctr East, Dept Pediat, Tokyo, Japan;

Here, we showed the tumor-suppressing potential of crude ethanolic extract of Philippine stingless bee propolis (EEP) in in vitro models of gastric cancer highlighting the first indication of remarkable subtype specificity towards differentiated-type human gastric cancer cell lines but not the diffuse-type. Mechanistically, this involved the profound modulation of several cell cycle related gene transcripts, which correlated with the prominent cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. To reinforce our data, a unique differentiated-type gastric cancer model, A4gnt KO mice, together with age-matched 60 week-old C57BL/6 J mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups receiving distilled water or EEP for 30 consecutive days. EEP treatment induced significant regression of gross and histological lesions of gastric pyloric tumors that consistently corresponded with specific transcriptional regulation of cell cycle components. Also, the considerable p21 protein expression coupled with a marked reduction in rapidly dividing BrdU-labeled S-phase cells unequivocally supported our observation. Altogether, these findings support the role of Philippine stingless bee propolis as a promising adjunct treatment option in differentiated-type gastric cancer.","[Desamero, Mark Joseph; Kakuta, Shigeru; Tang, Yulan; Kyuwa, Shigeru] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biomed Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Desamero, Mark Joseph; Estacio, Maria Amelita] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Vet Med, Dept Basic Vet Sci, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Desamero, Mark Joseph; Estacio, Maria Amelita; Cervancia, Cleofas] Univ Philippines Los Banos, UPLB Bee Program, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Cervancia, Cleofas] Univ Philippines Los Banos, Coll Arts & Sci, Inst Biol Sci, Laguna 4031, Philippines; [Chambers, James Kenn; Uchida, Kazuyuki; Nakayama, Hiroyuki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Vet Pathol, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Kominami, Yuri; Ushio, Hideki] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Marine Biochem, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan; [Nakayama, Jun] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mol Pathol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Kakuta, S (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Agr & Life Sci, Lab Biomed Sci, Bunkyo Ku, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138657, Japan.",akakuta@mail.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,"Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology [H29-1]; Kobayashi Foundation; KAKENHI from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [25670191]","This study was supported by a research grant for foreign students from the Tojuro Iijima Foundation for Food Science and Technology (H29-1, M.J.D. and S.K.), Kobayashi Foundation (S.K.), and the KAKENHI, Grantin-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) (#25670191, J.N. and S.K.).",,73,0,0,1,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,23-Dec,2019,9,,,,,,,,19635,10.1038/s41598-019-55465-4,,,13,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,KE9UW,WOS:000508896900026,31873082,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

Methods We enrolled 1002 patients with HCV (427 men, median age: 69 years) who had received DAAs for comparisons between CNALT (ALT <= 33 U/L in males and <= 25 U/L in females; n = 374) and non-CNALT (n = 628) groups. Results CNALT patients displayed a higher platelet count (PLT) (170 000 vs 146 000/mu L, P < 0.0001) and albumin (4.1 vs 4.1 g/dL, P = 0.0006) but lower AST (25 vs 51 U/L, P < 0.0001), alpha fetoprotein (3.2 vs 5.4 ng/mL, P < 0.0001), and liver fibrosis marker scores (all P < 0.0001). The sustained virologic response rate was comparable between the CNALT and non-CNALT groups (97.8 vs 95.3%, P = 0.106). The cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after DAA treatment was comparable between the CNALT and non-CNALT groups (P = 0.117, log-rank test). In CNALT patients with HCC history, PLT >= 150 000/mu L was an independent risk factor of HCC recurrence (P = 0.019). In non-CNALT patients without HCC history, male gender (P = 0.021) and albumin <4.0 g/dL (P = 0.007) were independent risk factors, while PLT < 150 000/mu L (P = 0.081) was a marginal risk factor of HCC occurrence. Conclusion CNALT patients displayed a milder degree of liver fibrosis. Combinations of CNALT and PLT status might be useful as markers for HCC occurrence or recurrence surveillance.","[Joshita, Satoru; Sugiura, Ayumi; Umemura, Takeji; Yamazaki, Tomoo; Fujimori, Naoyuki; Matsumoto, Akihiro; Tanaka, Eiji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Umemura, Takeji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Matsumoto, Akihiro] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Consultat Ctr Hepat Dis, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Usami, Yoko] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Umemura, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tumemura@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Umemura, Takeji/0000-0001-7985-919X; Joshita, Satoru/0000-0002-6364-9654","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [18K07907]; Viral Hepatitis Research Foundation of Japan; Nippon Kayaku; EisaiEisai Inc; Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma; Astellas Pharma Inc.Astellas Pharmaceuticals; Chugai Pharmaceutical; Takeda PharmaceuticalTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Otsuka PharmaceuticalOtsuka Pharmaceutical; Daiichi SankyoDaiichi Sankyo Company Limited; AbbVie; Taiju Life Social Welfare Foundation","Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture of Japan18K07907; Taiju Life Social Welfare Foundation; Viral Hepatitis Research Foundation of Japan; Nippon Kayaku; Eisai; Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma; Astellas Pharma Inc.; Chugai Pharmaceutical; Takeda Pharmaceutical; Otsuka Pharmaceutical; Daiichi Sankyo; AbbVie",,22,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",2397-9070,,,JGH OPEN,JGH Open,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1002/jgh3.12296,,19-Dec,8,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,JY2GL,WOS:000504238900001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020/4/20

A three-dimensional network of plate-shaped LDH particles was formed when theta-Al2O3 and gamma-Al2O3 were used, even though alpha-Al2O3 barely reacts to form the LDH phase. Finally, adsorption tests involving HPO42- ions confirmed that the fabricated LDH particles exhibited high ion-removal rates. The LDH particles prepared with theta-Al2O3 and gamma-Al2O3 could remove the hydrogen phosphate ions (HPO42-) in a concentration of 0.40 mmol g(-1) completely within 10 min; this is approximately 20 times shorter than the time taken by the LDH particles prepared from amorphous Al2O3.","[Sudare, Tomohito; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Zenzai, Atsushi; Tamura, Shuhei; Kiyama, Masahiro; Hayashi, Fumitaka; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",teshima@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"HAYASHI, Fumitaka/I-5366-2014","HAYASHI, Fumitaka/0000-0002-4494-739X","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25249089]; ""A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology"" project of the ""Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sci; Matching Planner Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) [VP30118068175]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [5RF-1902]","This work was partly supported by the following four national grants.

Penetration by pathogens is one of the most serious environmental insults. Wounding caused by tissue damage or herbivory also affects the growth and reproduction of plants. Moreover, wounding disrupts physical barriers present at the plant surface and increases the risk of pathogen invasion. Plants cope with environmental stress by inducing a variety of responses. These stress responses must be tightly controlled, because their unnecessary induction is detrimental to plant growth. In tobacco, WIPK and SIPK, two wound-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases, have been shown to play important roles in regulating wound responses. However, their contribution to downstream wound responses such as gene expression is not well understood. Results To identify genes regulated by WIPK and SIPK, the transcriptome of wounded WIPK/SIPK-suppressed plants was analyzed. Among the genes down-regulated in WIPK/SIPK-suppressed plants, the largest group consisted of those involved in the production of antimicrobial phytoalexins. Almost all genes involved in the biosynthesis of capsidiol, a major phytoalexin in tobacco, were transcriptionally induced by wounding in WIPK/SIPK-dependent and -independent manners. 5-epi-aristolochene synthase (EAS) is the committing enzyme for capsidiol synthesis, and the promoter of EAS4, a member of the EAS family, was analyzed. Reporter gene analysis revealed that at least two regions each 40-50 bp length were involved in activation of the EAS4 promoter by wounding, as well as by artificial activation of WIPK and SIPK. Unlike transcripts of the capsidiol synthesis genes, accumulation of EAS protein and capsidiol itself were not induced by wounding; however, wounding significantly enhanced their subsequent induction by a pathogen-derived elicitor. Conclusions Our results suggest a so-called priming phenomenon since the induction of EAS by wounding is only visible at the transcript level. By inducing transcripts, not the proteins, of EAS and possibly other capsidiol synthesis genes at wound sites, plants can produce large quantities of capsidiol quickly if pathogens invade the wound site, whereas plants can minimize energy loss and avoid the cytotoxic effects of capsidiol where pathogens do not gain entry during wound healing.","[Kojima, Tomoya; Asakura, Nobuhide; Hasegawa, Shiori; Hirasawa, Taishi; Katou, Shinpei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Mizuno, Yuri; Takemoto, Daigo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Bioagr Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Katou, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",shinpei@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [21880020, 23688005, 17 K07665]; Ministry of Education and Science, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [grant Nos. 21880020, 23688005, 17 K07665 to S.K.]; the Ministry of Education and Science, Japan [the Program for Dissemination of the TenureTrack System (to S.K.)].

We apply a scalable roll-press fabrication method to fabricate Ta3N5/Ti electrodes as a test case under ambient atmosphere. The purity of the Ta3N5 layer can be easily controlled by controlling the purity of the prepared particles. The photoelectrode with a Ta3N5 loading of 2.0 mg cm(-2), roll-press force of 10 kN, and Co-Pi cocatalyst generated an onset potential of ca. 0.6 V-RHE and a photoanodic current of ca. 3.0 +/- 0.2 mA cm(-2) (1.23 V-RHE) under artificial sunlight. The results indicate that compaction density and thickness of films are two of the main factors affecting the performance and can be controlled by roll pressing. In addition, the Faradic efficiency of oxygen generation on roll-press fabricated photoanode reached 83% (0.9 V-RHE). Upon further upscaling to an electrode size of 3 x 20 cm(2), the Ta3N5/Ti photoanode continued to present repeatable performance. The roll-press fabrication method may open an avenue to fabricate large-scale electrodes from temperature sensitive photocatalysts in solar energy conversion systems because of its high performance and low energy consumption.","[Xiao, Xiong; Iwase, Motoki; Yin, Ge] Japan Technol Res Assoc Artificial Photosynthet C, Chiyoda Ku, 2-11-9 Iwamotocho, Tokyo 1010032, Japan; [Xiao, Xiong; Iwase, Motoki; Yin, Ge; Watanabe, Tomoaki] Meiji Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Chem, Tama Ku, 1-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan; [Nakabayashi, Mamiko; Shibata, Naoya] Univ Tokyo, Inst Engn Innovat, Bunkyo Ku, 2-11-16 Yayoi, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Higashi, Tomohiro; Domen, Kazunari] Univ Tokyo, Dept Chem Syst Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan; [Domen, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Sci, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Watanabe, T (reprint author), Meiji Univ, Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Chem, Tama Ku, 1-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148571, Japan.",tomowata@meiji.ac.jp,"Shibata, Naoya/E-5327-2013","Nakabayashi, Mamiko/0000-0001-6101-0382; Domen, Kazunari/0000-0001-7995-4832","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under the Artificial Photosynthesis Project (ARPChem) of JapanNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO); ""Nanotechnology Platform"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan","This work was financially supported by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) under the Artificial Photosynthesis Project (ARPChem) of Japan.

In this paper, the influence of blood flow parameters and sensor installation conditions on the FBG sensor signal was verified using two blood flow simulation models. From the results of our study, the following observations were made. The fluid pressure increases, the wavelength shift of the FBG sensor beca me larger. By contrast, an increase in the viscosity of the fluid was seen to cause a decrease in the displacement length of the Bragg wavelength. Fluid pressure and viscosity were observed to opposite effects on the FBG sensor signal. The Bragg wavelength shift of the FBG sensor was observed to be larger when the installation direction of the FBG sensor was perpendicular to the blood flow direction than in the parallel direction. However, FBG sensor signals with higher signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio were measured at an angle of 75 degrees than at an angle of 90 degrees, which is perpendicular to the blood flow direction. From the above results, the installation condition of the FBG sensor on the measurement signal and the influence of each parameter of blood flow were established.","[Koyama, Shouhei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Hayase, Toshiyuki; Miyauchi, Suguru] Tohoku Univ, Inst Fluid Sci, Sendai, Miyagi 9808577, Japan; [Shirai, Atsushi] Kindai Univ, Grad Sch Syst Engn, Fac Engn, Hiroshima 7392116, Japan; [Chino, Shun; Haseda, Yuki] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Ishizawa, Hiroaki] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Koyama, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",shouhei@shinshu-u.ac.jp; hayase@ifs.tohoku.ac.jp; miyauchi@reynolds.ifs.tohoku.ac.jp; shirai@hiro.kindai.ac.jp; 17st108j@shinshu-u.ac.jp; 19hs115f@shinshu-u.ac.jp; zawa@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Koyama, Shouhei/0000-0003-4297-7648; Miyauchi, Suguru/0000-0002-4485-3764","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16H01805]; Research Institute and Academia (OPERA), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST); Creation of a Development Platform for Implantable/Wearable Medical Devices by a Novel Physiological Data Integration System of the Program on Open Innovation Platform with Enterprises","This work was supported in part by the JSPS KAKENHI under Grant JP16H01805, in part by the Creation of a Development Platform for Implantable/Wearable Medical Devices by a Novel Physiological Data Integration System of the Program on Open Innovation Platform with Enterprises, and in part by the Research Institute and Academia (OPERA), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).",,38,0,0,0,0,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1530-437X,1558-1748,,IEEE SENS J,IEEE Sens.

The molecular weight distribution of cellulose, and the rheological properties and spinnability of its spinning solution were evaluated. Scanning electron microscope observations indicated that the fine water mist/vapor was important for efficient coagulation of the stretched solution jets. Under optimized spinning parameters, a non-woven fabric was obtained consisting of fine fibers with an average diameter of 0.98 +/- 0.62 mu m. The tensile strength of the samples was greatly influenced by the fabric structure formed upon regeneration of cellulose from solution. X-ray diffraction and polarized optical microscopy measurements revealed that the prepared cellulosic non-woven fabric was highly crystalline and had a well-defined molecular orientation, respectively, which might have contributed to the increased tensile strength.","[Zhang, Jiaping; Gotoh, Yasuo] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Kitayama, Hideki; Gotoh, Yasuo] Shinshu Univ, Div Chem & Mat, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Gotoh, Yasuo] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Potthast, Antje; Rosenau, Thomas] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci Vienna, Dept Chem, Div Chem Renewable Resources, Muthgasse 18, A-1190 Vienna, Austria","Gotoh, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",ygotohy@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Potthast, Antje/Q-2816-2017","Potthast, Antje/0000-0003-1981-2271","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H01789]","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for the Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.

The cosmic ray intensity recorded with ground-based detectors also shows temporal variations arising from atmospheric variations. In the case of muon detectors, the main atmospheric effects are related to pressure and temperature changes. In this work, we analyze both effects using data recorded by the Global Muon Detector Network, consisting of four multidirectional muon detectors at different locations, in the period between 2007 and 2016. For each Global Muon Detector Network directional channel, we obtain coefficients that describe the pressure and temperature effects. We then analyze how these coefficients can be related to the geomagnetic cutoff rigidity and zenith angle associated with cosmic ray particles observed by each channel. In the pressure effect analysis, we found that the observed barometric coefficients show a very clear logarithmic correlation with the cutoff rigidity divided by the zenith angle cosine. On the other hand, the temperature coefficients show a good logarithmic correlation with the product of the cutoff and zenith angle cosine after adding a term proportional to the sine of geographical latitude of the observation site. This additional term implies that the temperature effect measured in the Northern Hemisphere detectors is stronger than that observed in the Southern Hemisphere. The physical origin of this term and of the good correlations found in this analysis should be studied in detail in future works.","[Mendonca, R. R.

However, confirmation of LA requires several different testing procedures, some of which can be difficult and require time. We report here a simple and highly specific method for detecting LA. Materials and Methods We examined 66 plasma samples obtained from LA-positive (LA) and 75 from LA-negative (non-LA) subjects, which included patients with acquired hemophilia and coagulation disorders, as well as from 43 healthy volunteer samples as normal controls. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was determined by adding 20 mmol of CaCl2 (Ca-APTT) or 25 mmol of a mixture of Mg and Ca (Mg-APTT). The ratio of Mg-APTT/Ca-APTT was then calculated and used as the Mg/Ca Index. Results The Mg/Ca Index value for the LA group was significantly lower than that for the non-LA and normal control groups (P < .0001). When the cutoff value of the Mg/Ca Index was less than 1.00, the sensitivity of LA determination using the Mg-APTT assay was 80.3%, while specificity was 100%. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the present Mg-APTT assay is a simple yet highly specific method for LA detection.","[Tokutake, Takayoshi; Baba, Hisami; Kobayashi, Hikaru] Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Transfus, Nagano, Japan; [Ieko, Masahiro] Hlth Sci Univ Hokkaido, Sch Dent, Dept Internal Med, Kanazawa 1757, Ishikari, Hokkaido 0610293, Japan; [Naito, Sumiyoshi] Hosp Hlth Sci Univ Hokkaido, Dept Clin Lab, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Yoshida, Mika] Hosp Hlth Sci Univ Hokkaido, Dept Clin Lab, Ishikari, Hokkaido, Japan; [Kobayashi, Hikaru] Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Hematol, Nagano, Japan; [Ishida, Fumihiro] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Biomed Lab Sci, Sch Hlth Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Ieko, M (reprint author), Hlth Sci Univ Hokkaido, Sch Dent, Dept Internal Med, Kanazawa 1757, Ishikari, Hokkaido 0610293, Japan.",iekom@hoku-iryo-u.ac.jp,,,Shinshu Medical Promotion Association,This study was supported in part by a Shinshu Medical Promotion Association subsidy (2014).,,12,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1751-5521,1751-553X,,INT J LAB HEMATOL,Int.

The inflation of falsely rejected hypotheses associated with multiple hypothesis testing is seen as a threat to the knowledge base in the scientific literature. One of the most recently developed statistical constructs to deal with this problem is the false discovery rate (FDR), which aims to control the proportion of the falsely rejected null hypotheses among those that are rejected. FDR has been applied to a variety of problems, especially for the analysis of 3-D brain images in the field of Neuroimaging, where the predominant form of statistical inference involves the more conventional control of false positives, through Gaussian random field theory (RFT). In this study we considered FDR and RFT as alternative methods for handling multiple testing in the analysis of 1-D continuum data. The field of biomechanics has recently adopted RFT, but to our knowledge FDR has not previously been used to analyze 1-D biomechanical data, nor has there been a consideration of how FDR vs. RFT can affect biomechanical interpretations. Methods. We reanalyzed a variety of publicly available experimental datasets to understand the characteristics which contribute to the convergence and divergence of RFT and FDR results. We also ran a variety of numerical simulations involving smooth, random Gaussian 1-D data, with and without true signal, to provide complementary explanations for the experimental results. Results. Our results suggest that RFT and FDR thresholds (the critical test statistic value used to judge statistical significance) were qualitatively identical for many experimental datasets, but were highly dissimilar for others, involving non-trivial changes in data interpretation. Simulation results clarified that RFT and FDR thresholds converge as the true signal weakens and diverge when the signal is broad in terms of the proportion of the continuum size it occupies. Results also showed that, while sample size affected the relation between RFT and FDR results for small sample sizes (<15), this relation was stable for larger sample sizes, wherein only the nature of the true signal was important. Discussion. RFT and FDR thresholds are both computationally efficient because both are parametric, but only FDR has the ability to adapt to the signal features of particular datasets, wherein the threshold lowers with signal strength for a gain in sensitivity. Additional advantages and limitations of these two techniques as discussed further. This article is accompanied by freely available software for implementing FDR analyses involving 1-D data and scripts to replicate our results.","[Naouma, Hanaa] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Bioengn Course, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Naouma, Hanaa; Pataky, Todd C.] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Human Hlth Sci, Kyoto, Japan","Pataky, TC (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Human Hlth Sci, Kyoto, Japan.",pataky.todd.2m@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Kiban B Grant from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17H02151]","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid from Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and by the Kiban B Grant 17H02151 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.

Some PBC patients display disease progression regardless of medical treatment. Therefore, it is important to accurately diagnose the clinical stage of PBC. This study investigated clinical merits of vibration-controlled transient elastography using FibroScan for assessing disease stage in PBC. Methods A total of 74 treatment-naive PBC patients (84% female, median age: 64 years), 69 of whom having undergone histological assessment and five clinically diagnosed as at the cirrhosis stage, were enrolled for clinical comparisons of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) with other established indices. Results The number of patients with Nakanuma stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 was 18, 33, 17, and 6, respectively. The median LSM values for Nakanuma stages 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 5.05, 5.90, 8.90, and 23.70 kPa, respectively, and correlated significantly with disease progression based on Nakanuma's classification (r = 0.501, P < 0.001). LSM was also significantly related to other non-invasive serological markers (Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer: r = 0.606, FIB-4 index: r = 0.493, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index: r = 0.577; all P < 0.001). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for diagnosing Nakanuma stage >= 2, stage >= 3, and stage 4 were 0.744, 0.763, and 0.907, respectively. A combination of LSM >= 7.0 kPa and Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer >= 1.00 cut-off index could predict late-stage PBC (i.e. moderate to advanced disease progression) with a sensitivity of 0.58, specificity of 0.82, and accuracy of 0.74. Conclusions Liver stiffness measurement using FibroScan provided simple, accurate, and non-invasive assessment of disease stage in PBC patients.","[Joshita, Satoru; Yamashita, Yuki; Sugiura, Ayumi; Yamazaki, Tomoo; Fujimori, Naoyuki; Matsumoto, Akihiro; Umemura, Takeji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Uehara, Takeshi; Usami, Yoko] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tanaka, Eiji] Shinshu Univ, Dept Promot Reg Med, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Umemura, Takeji] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Life Innovat, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Joshita, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",joshita@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Joshita, Satoru/0000-0002-6364-9654; Yamashita, Yuki/0000-0002-0162-4208; Umemura, Takeji/0000-0001-7985-919X",,,,44,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0815-9319,1440-1746,,J GASTROEN HEPATOL,J.

Intriguing substituent effects of TAPS were observed, in which electron-donating groups enhanced their reactivity. In addition, the mechanism was thoroughly investigated by undertaking both experimental and theoretical studies, suggesting that the electronic properties of TAPS affect carbon dioxide insertion into halohydrin intermediates. The results provided fruitful information to understand the origin of the TAPS behavior, which would contribute to the design of novel catalysts for carbon dioxide capture.","[Toda, Yasunori; Komiyama, Yutaka; Suga, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mat Chem, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Esaki, Hiroyoshi; Fukushima, Kazuaki] Hyogo Coll Med, Dept Chem, 1-1 Mukogawa Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan","Toda, Y; Suga, H (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mat Chem, Fac Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Fukushima, K (reprint author), Hyogo Coll Med, Dept Chem, 1-1 Mukogawa Cho, Nishinomiya, Hyogo 6638501, Japan.",ytoda@shinshu-u.ac.jp; ka-fukushima@hyo-med.ac.jp; sugahio@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Fukushima, Kazuaki/0000-0003-3756-5876","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP17K14483, JP17KT0096, 19K05454]","This work was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) through a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) (Grant No. JP17K14483) and Scientific Research (C) (Grant No. JP17KT0096, 19K05454).",,84,0,0,21,21,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0022-3263,1520-6904,,J ORG CHEM,J.

However, animal models do not recapitulate all the phenotypes that are specific to human disease. This is mainly due to the genetic, anatomical and physiological difference in the neuromuscular systems of animals and humans. The emergence of direct and indirect human somatic cell reprogramming technologies may overcome this limitation because they enable the use of disease and patient-specific cellular models as enhanced platforms for drug discovery and autologous cell-based therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and urine-derived stem cells (USCs) are increasingly employed to recapitulate the pathophysiology of various human diseases. Recent cell-based modeling approaches utilize highly complex differentiation systems that faithfully mimic human tissue- and organ-level dysfunctions.

Insects have two types of insulin family peptides: insulin-like peptides and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-like peptides (IGFLPs). We recently demonstrated that an IGFLP in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori (BIGFLP) promotes the growth of the genital imaginal disc ex vivo. However, the role of BIGFLP in the regulation of insect growth remains unclear because no in vivo study has been performed. Therefore, we analysed the functions of BIGFLP in vivo by constructing BIGFLP knock-out (KO) B. mori using the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) system. The KO moths exhibited decreased body weights and size of the appendages compared wild-type (wt) moths. Interestingly, KO females also had drastically lower ovary weights and number of eggs than wt females. However, mutant ovaries that were transplanted into wt host pupae reached a similar weight to wt ovaries that were transplanted into the wt hosts, suggesting that IGFLP in the haemolymph promotes ovarian development. These findings show that BIGFLP regulates the growth and development of adult organs, particularly the ovaries, in B. mori.","[Fujinaga, Daiki; Kataoka, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan; [Shiomi, Kunihiro] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Yagi, Yoshimasa] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Div Biol Sci, Nagoya, Aichi 4648602, Japan; [Mizoguchi, Akira] Aichi Gakuin Univ, Div Liberal Arts & Sci, Nisshin, Aichi 4700195, Japan","Kataoka, H (reprint author), Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, Dept Integrated Biosci, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778562, Japan.; Mizoguchi, A (reprint author), Aichi Gakuin Univ, Div Liberal Arts & Sci, Nisshin, Aichi 4700195, Japan.",kataoka@edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp; amizo@dpc.agu.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [26660266, 15H04610]","The wild-type silkmoth strain Kosetsu was obtained from the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences.

With aging comes an increase in the incidence of sensory impairments, which promotes the development of dementia. We investigated the association between sensory impairments - visual impairment (VI), hearing impairment (HI), and dual sensory impairment (DSI), the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and dementia incidence. Methods This was a retrospective study that used Japanese long-term care insurance certification data from 2010 to 2017 of City A. The 2190 older adults who did not have dementia in 2010 were classified into four impairment categories: VI, HI, DSI, and no sensory impairment. The incidence of dementia was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank testing. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to investigate the risk of developing dementia associated with sensory impairments, compared to the risk for no sensory impairment. Pearson's chi(2) tests were used to compare the prevalence of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia among the four groups. Results HI and DSI were associated with a higher cumulative dementia incidence compared to no sensory impairment (log-rank chi(2) = 10.42; P < 0.001, and log-rank chi(2) = 39.92; P < 0.001, respectively), and DSI showed higher cumulative dementia incidence than HI (log-rank chi(2) = 11.37; P = 0.001). Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that DSI is the greatest risk factor for developing dementia among sensory impairments (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.22-1.71; P < 0.001). Older adults with VI had a significantly higher prevalence of day-night reversal than the other groups. Conclusions Our results indicate that older adults with sensory impairments have a high incidence of dementia, with DSI presenting the greatest risk. Older adults with VI were found to be more likely to have day-night reversal symptoms when dementia occurs.","[Maruta, Michio] Okatsu Hosp, Med Corp, Dept Rehabil, 3-95 Masagohonmachi, Kagoshima 8900067, Japan; [Tabira, Takayuki; Yoshimitsu, Koji] Kagoshima Univ, Fac Med, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Occupat Therapy, Kagoshima, Japan; [Sagari, Akira] Shinshu Univ, Fac Med, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Occupat Therapy, Nagano, Japan; [Miyata, Hironori] Kumamoto Hlth Sci Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Rehabil, Div Occupat Therapy, Kumamoto, Japan; [Han, Gwanghee; Yoshiura, Kazuhiro] Kumamoto Univ Hosp, Dept Neuropsychiat, Kumamoto, Japan; [Matsuo, Takashi] Nishikyusyu Univ, Fac Rehabil Sci, Kanzaki, Saga, Japan; [Kawagoe, Masahiro] Saitama Prefectural Univ, Grad Course Hlth & Social Serv, Saitama, Japan","Maruta, M (reprint author), Okatsu Hosp, Med Corp, Dept Rehabil, 3-95 Masagohonmachi, Kagoshima 8900067, Japan.",m.maru0111@gmail.com,,"Maruta, Michio/0000-0003-0820-7738",,,,65,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1346-3500,1479-8301,,PSYCHOGERIATRICS,Psychogeriatrics,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/psyg.12494,,19-Dec,9,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry,Geriatrics & Gerontology; Psychiatry,JS5TJ,WOS:000500368300001,31799771,,,,2020/4/20

Four years following hemodialysis, he started taking lanthanum carbonate 1500 mg/day and lansoprazole 30 mg/day. Nine years following hemodialysis, he underwent screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which demonstrated the presence of the whitish cobblestone-like mucosa in the gastric corpus and multiple reddish depressed lesions with annular whitish mucosa in the antrum. With magnified narrow-band imaging endoscopy, a yellowish-white substance was observed in the villous structure, and subepithelial vessels were observed on the yellowish-white substance. Biopsies were taken from the whitish cobblestone-like mucosa of the upper corpus, a reddish depressed part of the antrum. Histologically, aggregates of cells containing amphophilic fine granular material were found in the mucosal interstitium. These cells stained positive for CD68 and were identified as histiocytes. Since he had been taking lanthanum carbonate for 5 years, we considered the possibility of histiocyte-mediated phagocytosis of lanthanum. Digital mapping via scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry showed the presence of lanthanum and phosphorus in the interstitium and cytoplasm of histiocytes. The white, rough mucosa in the gastric body appeared 6 months following the commencement of lanthanum administration and still exists 3 years and 5 months after discontinuation of lanthanum.","[Yamada, Takahiro; Tomori, Akihisa] Saku Cent Hosp, Adv Care Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 3400-28 Nakagomi, Saku, Nagano 3850051, Japan; [Oyama, Tsuneo; Takahashi, Akiko] Saku Cent Hosp, Adv Care Ctr, Dept Endoscopy, Saku, Nagano, Japan; [Kametani, Kiyokazu] Shinshu Univ, Res Ctr Human & Environm Sci, Div Instrumental Anal, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Shiozawa, Satoshi] Saku Cent Hosp Adv Care Ctr, Clin Pathol, Saku, Nagano, Japan; [Ota, Hiroyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Biomed Lab Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Shimoda, Tadakazu] Shizuoka Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, Shizuoka, Japan","Yamada, T (reprint author), Saku Cent Hosp, Adv Care Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 3400-28 Nakagomi, Saku, Nagano 3850051, Japan.",hardswimdrummer@yahoo.co.jp,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",1865-7257,1865-7265,,CLIN J GASTROENTEROL,Clin.

Highly crystalline [Ni0.67Co0.33(OH)(2)]Cl-0.29 center dot 0.53H(2)O (Ni-Co LDH) particles with an exceptionally high anion-exchange capacity of 58.8 mg g(-1) and a distribution coefficient (K-d) of 2396 mL g(-1) for NO3- ions were successfully prepared by the flux method and a topochemical strategy. Layered Na0.97Ni0.67Co0.33O2 (NNCO) was prepared using a high-temperature flux and used as a starting material for topotactic transformation consisting of oxidative hydrolysis with KOH and NaClO and subsequent reduction with H2O2 and NaCl. During the transformation from NNCO to Ni-Co LDH, a drastic change in the valences of the Ni and Co belonging to the host layer and in the cationic and anionic species occurs in interlayer space; the valences of the Ni and Co in NNCO were increased from Ni-2+,Ni-3+ and Co-2+,Co-3+ to Ni3+ and Co-2+,Co-31+,Co-4+ by an oxidative hydrolysis reaction with simultaneous intercalation of K+ ions and deintercalation of Na+ ions, and subsequently decreased from Ni3+ and Co-2+,Co-3+,Co-4+ to Ni2+ and Co-2+,Co-3+ by a reduction reaction with simultaneous intercalation of anionic species such as CO32- and Cl- ions and deintercalation of Na+ and K+ ions. Through synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction analysis and Rietveld refinement, the resultant Ni-Co LDH was clearly shown to exhibit high crystallinity with less compositional deviation even after topochemical transformation in comparison with the one prepared by traditional coprecipitation and solid-state methods. Furthermore, the adsorption isotherm for NO3- ions elucidated that homogeneous adsorption sites are consistently constructed in the crystal structure, which could be found from the fitting to a Langmuir curve, with the R-2 value being 0.98. This work opens up a new route for the fabrication of excellent not only ion-exchangeable but also ion-conductive inorganic materials for direct utilization in environmental and energy-storage processes.","[Sudare, Tomohito; Tanaka, Hideki; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Tamura, Shuhei; Hayashi, Fumitaka; Teshima, Katsuya] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Teshima, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Mat Chem, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",teshima@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"HAYASHI, Fumitaka/I-5366-2014","HAYASHI, Fumitaka/0000-0002-4494-739X","A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology project of the ""Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sci; Matching Planner Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [5RF-1902]","This work was supported by the ""A Shinshu-Method for Regional Innovation Ecosystem by Industrial Implementation of Innovative Inorganic Crystal Material Technology"" project of the ""Program on Regional Innovation and Ecosystem Formation"" of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan, and the Matching Planner Program of the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

A basal land plant, Marchantia polymorpha, develops clonal propagules, gemmae, on the gametophyte thallus from the basal epidermis of a specialized receptacle, the gemma cup. Here we report an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, designated GEMMA CUP-ASSOCIATED MYB1 (GCAM1), which is an essential regulator of gemma cup development in M. polymorpha. Targeted disruption of GCAM1 conferred a complete loss of gemma cup formation and gemma generation. Ectopic overexpression of GCAM1 resulted in formation of cell clumps, suggesting a function of GCAM1 in suppression of cell differentiation. Although gemma cups are a characteristic gametophyte organ for vegetative reproduction in a taxonomically restricted group of liverwort species, phylogenetic and interspecific complementation analyses support the orthologous relationship of GCAM1 to regulatory factors of axillary meristem formation, e.g., Arabidopsis REGULATOR OF AXILLARY MERISTEMS and tomato Blind, in angiosperm sporophytes. The present findings in M. polymorpha suggest an ancient acquisition of a transcriptional regulator for production of asexual propagules in the gametophyte and the use of the regulatory factor for diverse developmental programs, including axillary meristem formation, during land plant evolution.","[Yasui, Yukiko; Tsukamoto, Shigeyuki; Kato, Hirotaka; Fukaki, Hidehiro; Mimura, Tetsuro; Ishizaki, Kimitsune] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Yasui, Yukiko; Kohchi, Takayuki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Biostudies, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Sugaya, Tomomi; Kubo, Hiroyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Wang, Quan] Max Planck Inst Plant Breeding Res, Dept Plant Breeding & Genet, Carl von Linne Weg 10, D-50829 Cologne, Germany; [Yamato, Katsuyuki T.] Kindai Univ, Fac Biol Oriented Sci & Technol, 930 Nishimitani, Wakayama 6496493, Japan","Ishizaki, K (reprint author), Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",kimi@emerald.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"Max Planck SocietyMax Planck SocietyFoundation CELLEX; NIBB Collaborative Research Program [15-823]; MEXT KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18H04836, 25113009, 25119711, 15H01233, 17H06472]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H04391, 19H03247, 19K16167]; SUNTORY Foundation for Life SciencesSuntory Foundation for Life Sciences; Yamada Science Foundation; Asahi Glass Foundation","The authors thank John L.

Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was mainly used to investigate the effects of solution alkalinity, polarity, and hydrothermal temperature on the size and morphology evolution of BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The results indicate that the presence of strong alkalinity improved the size evenness of BaTiO3 nanoparticles possibly because of the re-dissolution and re-precipitation of TiO32- ions. BaTiO3 nanoparticles with the average diameters of approximately 21 and 53 nm were obtained in 9:1 and 1:1 EtOH/H2O (v/v) hydrothermal medium, respectively. Compared with that, the size of BaTiO3 particles prepared in pure distilled water reached up to similar to 512 nm. As for the reason, the addition of EtOH could lower the polarity of hydrothermal medium and make the medium reach the supersaturation more easily, thus limiting the size growth of BaTiO3 particles. In addition, the presence of EtOH led to easier formation of BaTiO3 nanoparticles even at mild hydrothermal temperature, but the particle size was limited even though the temperature was much increased. This is possibly due to lowered interfacial activity in the presence of EtOH. By adjusting solution alkalinity, EtOH/H2O volume ratios, and hydrothermal temperature, BaTiO3 nanoparticles with the average sizes of approximately 21, 53, 104, 284, and 512 nm, were obtained, and more different and controlled nano-sizes can be expected by further hydrothermal adjustment. In the end, microwave absorption evaluation indicated that decreased size of the BaTiO3 particles enhanced the reflection loss. One possible reason is that the decreased nano-size led to the increased specific surface area of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles.","[Yan, Yongjie] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Xia, Hong; Ni, Qing-Qing] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan; [Fu, Yaqin] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Key Lab Adv Text Mat & Mfg Technol, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhenzhen; Ni, Qing-Qing] Anhui Polytech Univ, Coll Text & Garments, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China","Ni, QQ (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan.; Ni, QQ (reprint author), Anhui Polytech Univ, Coll Text & Garments, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",yongjieyanlxl@gmail.com; hxia@shinshu-u.ac.jp; fyq01@zstu.edu.cn; xuzhenzhen@ahpu.edu.cn; niqq@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Dong, Yubing/0000-0001-5589-1654","JSPS (MEXT) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H01789, 26420721]; Nanotechnology Platform Program, Shinshu University","This work was supported by JSPS (MEXT financial supports) KAKENHI No 15H01789 and 26420721.

Practically, increased ALP accompanied by no other hepatotoxic changes is often encountered in toxicity studies of pesticides in dogs. Here, we analyzed the toxicological significance of increased ALP in response to 206 pesticides evaluated by the Food Safety Commission of Japan as toxicological evaluation reports in their risk assessment process. Our analysis indicated that increased ALP was more frequent in dogs (108/206) than in rats (36/206). In 87 of 108 pesticides, increased ALP was observed with hepatotoxicity in dogs. However, increased ALP had no specific relationship with certain types of hepatotoxicity and was not a sensitive marker of hepatotoxicity. Approximately 50% of 87 pesticides showing hepatotoxicity also induced liver hypertrophy. No hepatotoxic changes were seen with the remaining 21 pesticides, other than increases in liver weight and/or liver hypertrophy. Most of these 21 pesticides were phenobarbital-like liver metabolism enzyme inducers in rodents. These results suggested that increased ALP was not an indicator of hepatotoxicity in dogs if hepatotoxic findings were absent. This analysis provided a new interpretation of the toxicological significance of ALP in dogs and could contribute to toxicological evaluation of pesticides.","[Yokoyama, Yoko; Yoshida, Midori] Food Safety Commiss Japan, Minato Ku, 5-2-20 Akasaka, Tokyo 1076122, Japan; [Yokoyama, Yoko; Saito, Mikako] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, 2-24-16 Naka Cho, Koganei, Tokyo 1848588, Japan; [Ono, Atsushi] Okayama Univ, Kita Ku, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Matsumoto, Kiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Yokoyama, Y (reprint author), Food Safety Commiss Japan, Minato Ku, 5-2-20 Akasaka, Tokyo 1076122, Japan.; Saito, M (reprint author), Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, 2-24-16 Naka Cho, Koganei, Tokyo 1848588, Japan.",yoko.yokoyama.h8w@cao.go.jp; mikako@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"Saito, Mikako/E-6788-2013","Ono, Atsushi/0000-0001-5056-0442",,,,20,0,0,0,0,ACADEMIC PRESS INC ELSEVIER SCIENCE,SAN DIEGO,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",0273-2300,1096-0295,,REGUL TOXICOL PHARM,Regul.

Two AS samples were collected from different aeration processes at the same plant and one sample was collected from a different plant; these were used for the degradation of synthetic wastewater containing commercial food oil as the sole carbon source. A 16S rRNA gene-based next generation sequencing technique was applied to study the bacterial community in the seed AS samples and resultant water after in vitro degradation for two days. Out of the total assigned genera of 319, 153 were present in all three AS seed samples, while the remaining 166 genera, observed in one or two AS seed samples, accounted for only 5% of the total operational taxonomic units. We found that different bacterial groups of each AS capable of oil degradation were present in the samples after two days' incubation. This suggests that the oil degradation process differently affected the key microbial groups from different sources. Therefore, monitoring of the AS seed and optimizing the degradation condition may be required to achieve efficient degradation performance.","[Uyeno, Yutaka] Shinshu Univ, Acad Assembly Inst Agr, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Matsumoto, Akito] Shinshu Univ, Acad Assembly Inst Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Uyeno, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Acad Assembly Inst Agr, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",ytkuyeno@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Center of Innovation initiative of research achievements promotion program, Japan Science and Technology Agency","This study was financially supported by the Center of Innovation initiative of research achievements promotion program, Japan Science and Technology Agency.",,15,0,0,0,0,IWA PUBLISHING,LONDON,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",1751-231X,,,WATER PRACT TECHNOL,Water Pract.

The present study describes two male siblings, aged 7 and 1 yr old, with severe ID, spastic quadriplegia, nystagmus, and brain atrophy with acquired microcephaly. We used the exome sequencing to identify the causative gene in the patients and identified a hemizygous missense variant, c.1282T>A (p.W428R), in the p21-activated serine/threonine kinase 3 gene (PAK3), which is associated with X-linked ID. p.W428R is located within the highly conserved kinase domain and was predicted to induce loss of enzymatic function by three mutation prediction tools (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and MutationTaster). In addition, this variant has not been reported in public databases (as of the middle of December 2018) or in the data from 3275 individuals of the Japanese general population analyzed using high-depth whole-genome sequencing. To date, only 13 point mutations and deletions in PAK3 in ID have been reported. The literature review illustrated a phenotypic spectrum of PAK3 pathogenic variant, and our cases represented the most severe form of the PAK3-associated phenotypes.

A variety of vital signs including blood pressure can be derived from these signals. However, silica optical fiber presents a safety risk because it is easily fractured. In this research, an FBG sensor fabricated in plastic optical fiber (POF-FBG) was employed to resolve this problem. Pulse wave signals were measured by POF-FBG and silica-FBG sensors for four subjects. After signal processing, a calibration curve was constructed by partial least squares regression, then blood pressure was calculated from the calibration curve. As a result, the POF-FBG sensor could measure the pulse wave signals with an signal to noise (SN) ratio at least eight times higher than the silica-FBG sensor. Further, the measured signals were substantially similar to those of an acceleration plethysmograph (APG). Blood pressure is measured with low error, but the POF-FBG APG correlation is distributed from 0.54 to 0.72, which is not as high as desired. Based on these results, pulse wave signals should be measured under a wide range of reference blood pressures to confirm the reliability of blood pressure measurement uses POF-FBG sensors.","[Haseda, Yuki] Shinshu Univ, Gratuate Sch Med Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Bonefacino, Julien; Tam, Hwa-Yaw] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Photon Res Ctr, Dept Elect Engn, Hung Hom,Kowloon, 11 Yuk Choi Rd, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Chino, Shun] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Koyama, Shouhei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Ishizawa, Hiroaki] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Koyama, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",19hs115f@shinshu-u.ac.jp; jeebonef@polyu.edu.hk; Hwa-yaw.tam@polyu.edu.hk; 17st108j@shinshu-u.ac.jp; shouhei@shinshu-u.ac.jp; zawa@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Koyama, Shouhei/0000-0003-4297-7648","JSPS KAKNHI [JP16H01805]; Wearable Vital Signs Measurement System Development Project at Shinshu University; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Creation of a development platform for implantable/wearable medical devices by a novel physiological data integration system of the Program on Open Innovation Platform with Enterprises, Research Institute and Academia (OPERA) from the Japan Science and Tec [JPMJOP1722]; General Research Fund Project [PolyU 152207/18E]; PolyU Central Grant project [1-ZVGB]","This work was supported by JSPS KAKNHI, grant Number JP16H01805 and the Wearable Vital Signs Measurement System Development Project at Shinshu University.

Methods The present study analyzed 183 cases of small bowel capsule endoscope (SBCE) insertion performed using the AdvanCE in 154 patients aged less than 18 years at participating institutions between 2013 and 2017. Statistical analyses were conducted to identify factors contributing to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination, small intestine transit time, adverse events and technical issues. Results The commonest reason for using the AdvanCE was the patient's inability to swallow the SBCE, which was attributed to young age. SBCE was successfully delivered into the stomach or duodenum in 180 cases and was placed in the duodenum in 90% patients. In 89% patients, the entire small intestine was completely examined, and in 63% patients, findings leading to a new diagnosis or involving changing or maintaining the treatment strategy were obtained. No severe adverse events were observed; however, mild adverse events were observed in 35% patients. No factors considerably contributed to the completion rate for the entire small intestine examination or small intestine transit time and onset of technical issues. The factors that contributed to mild adverse events included intravenous anesthesia, technical issue, and absence of prior insertion of a patency capsule using the AdvanCE.

To avoid hazardous manipulations, scarifying the ipsilateral SHA under visual evoked potential (VEP) guidance can be done without risk of postoperative visual decline. This technique is associated with better visual outcome.(1) A 66-yr-old woman presented with gradually enlarging right paraclinoid carotidophthalmic and SHA aneurysms. The relationship between those aneurysms and the critical neurovascular structures made us facing a daunting challenge to preserve the visual function. To preserve the patency of the ophthalmic artery (oph.A), endovascular intervention was abandoned and a direct clipping surgery was selected. Following VEP settings, exposure of the cervical internal carotid artery for proximal control and right frontotemporal craniotomy, a subfrontal approach was used. To get adequate accessibility and safe maneuverability, the anterior clinoidectomy and unroofing of the optic canal were completed, then, the falciform ligament and the distal dural ring were carefully opened. Under VEP guidance, the oph.A and SHAs were temporarily occluded. VEP had been stable under repeated occlusions. The carotidophthalmic aneurysm was clipped with preservation of the oph.A. Besides, 1 ipsilateral SHA was sacrificed to achieve complete clipping of the SHA aneurysm. Final indocyanine green videoangiography confirmed obliteration of the paraclinoid aneurysms and patency of the oph.A, the other SHA and the tiny arterioles around the optic nerve. The postoperative course was uneventful. There was no evidence of postoperative visual disturbances.

Here, we investigated whether okara, a soybean by-product rich in dietary fiber, can attenuate cognitive impairment in senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice by altering gut microbial composition. Mice were fed either a standard diet, or a diet containing okara (7.5% or 15%, w/w) for 26 weeks. In the memory test, the 7.5% okara-fed mice showed a longer step-through latency and the 15% okara-fed mice had a short escape latency compared with control mice. The 15% okara-fed mice displayed decreased body weight, increased fecal weight, and altered cecal microbiota composition compared with the control group; however, there was no significant difference in the serum lactic acid and butyric acid levels among these mice groups. The 7.5% okara-fed mice had significantly higher NeuN intensity in the hippocampus compared with control mice. Furthermore, a decrease in inflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and an increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was observed in the 7.5% okara-fed group. The expression of synthesizing enzyme of acetylcholine was increased by the okara diets, and the acetylcholine level in the brain was higher in the 7.5% okara-fed group than in the control. These suggest that oral administration of okara could delay cognitive decline without drastically changing gut microbiota.","[Corpuz, Henry M.; Nakamura, Soichiro; Katayama, Shigeru] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Corpuz, Henry M.] Philippine Rice Res Inst, Rice Chem & Food Sci Div, Sci City Of Munoz 3119, Nueva Ecija, Philippines; [Arimura, Misa; Chawalitpong, Supatta; Nakamura, Soichiro; Katayama, Shigeru] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Miyazaki, Keiko; Sawaguchi, Makoto] Misuzu Corp Co Ltd, 1606 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3800928, Japan; [Katayama, Shigeru] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan","Katayama, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Katayama, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Katayama, S (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, 8304 Minamiminowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",15st553b@shinshu-u.ac.jp; 17as202g@shinshu-u.ac.jp; supattra.chawalitpong@gmail.com; nakazawa-k@misuzu-co.co.jp; sawamako@misuzu-co.co.jp; snakamu@shinshu-u.ac.jp; skata@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,39,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6643,,NUTRIENTS,Nutrients,DEC,2019,11,12,,,,,,,2939,10.3390/nu11122939,,,12,Nutrition & Dietetics,Nutrition & Dietetics,KC0ZV,WOS:000506917800101,31816987,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

We performed DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus for treatment of coarse action tremor in a patient with SCA2 (spinocerebellar ataxia type 2) in the wheelchair-bound stage. Although improvement of the tremor of the proximal part was incomplete, the patient regained substantial parts of daily functioning. The effect lasted for more than 6 years, and the suppression of tremor significantly contributed to maintaining the level of the patient's expression into the bedridden stage. Vim DBS can be a treatment option for tremor in SCA patients, even in the advanced stage, as long as the tremor is depriving the patient of behavioral expression. As residual proximal tremor may hamper functional recovery, DBS of other targets or multi-targets should be further explored to attain a better outcome.","[Isobe, Takashi; Sato, Hiromasa; Hashimoto, Takao] Aizawa Hosp, Dept Neurol, 2-5-1 Honjo, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908510, Japan; [Goto, Tetsuya] Shinshu Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yako, Takehiro] Aizawa Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yoshida, Kunihiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Brain Dis Res, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Hashimoto, T (reprint author), Aizawa Hosp, Dept Neurol, 2-5-1 Honjo, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908510, Japan.",sinke-dr@ai-hosp.or.jp,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1011-6125,1423-0372,,STEREOT FUNCT NEUROS,Stereotact.

The results showed that the fiber diameters and surface morphology of PHBH composite nanofibers were influenced by the addition of ethanol-centella (EC), methanol-centella (MC), ethanol-propolis (EP), and ethanol-hinokitiol (EH) at various ratios compared to pristine PHBH nanofibers. From FT-IR, the nanofibrous samples with higher contents of natural antibacterial substances showed the peaks of carboxylic acid, aromatic ring, and tropolone carbon ring from centella, propolis, and hinokitiol, respectively. Furthermore, the tensile strength of neat PHBH nanofibers was increased from 8.00 +/- 0.71 MPa up to 16.35 +/- 1.78 MPa by loading of propolis (EP) 7% into PHBH. X-ray analysis explained that the loading of propolis (EP) was also able to increase the crystallinity in PHBH composite nanofibers from 47.0% to 54.5%. The antibacterial results demonstrated that PHBH composite nanofibers containing natural antibacterial products were potent inhibitors against the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, amongst them hinokitiol and propolis proved to be the most effective. Additionally, the release studies displayed that centella and hinokitiol had faster release from PHBH composite nanofibers in comparison to propolis.","[Rebia, Rina Afiani] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Sadon, Nurul Shaheera Binti; Tanaka, Toshihisa] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Tanaka, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",rina_rebia@yahoo.com; shera9410@gmail.com; tanakat@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program for Fiber Renaissance from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan","This research was supported by Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program for Fiber Renaissance from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport, Science, and Technology (MEXT), Japan.",,44,2,2,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2079-4991,,NANOMATERIALS-BASEL,Nanomaterials,DEC,2019,9,12,,,,,,,1665,10.3390/nano9121665,,,18,"Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science,KB7MY,WOS:000506675800021,31766678,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

The objectives of the effort are presented along with an overview of the coverage of eddy covariance (EC) CH4 flux measurements globally, initial results comparing CH4 fluxes across the sites, and future research directions and needs. Annual estimates of net CH4 fluxes across sites ranged from -0.2 +/- 0.02 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for an upland forest site to 114.9 +/- 13.4 g C m(-2) yr(-1) for an estuarine freshwater marsh, with fluxes exceeding 40 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at multiple sites. Average annual soil and air temperatures were found to be the strongest predictor of annual CH4 flux across wetland sites globally. Water table position was positively correlated with annual CH4 emissions, although only for wetland sites that were not consistently inundated throughout the year. The ratio of annual CH4 fluxes to ecosystem respiration increased significantly with mean site temperature. Uncertainties in annual CH4 estimates due to gap-filling and random errors were on average +/- 1.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at 95% confidence, with the relative error decreasing exponentially with increasing flux magnitude across sites. Through the analysis and synthesis of a growing EC CH4 flux database, the controls on ecosystem CH4 fluxes can be better understood, used to inform and validate Earth system models, and reconcile differences between land surface model- and atmospheric-based estimates of CH4 emissions.","[Knox, Sara H.; McNicol, Gavin; Fluet-Chouinard, Etienne] Stanford Univ, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Knox, Sara H.] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Jackson, Robert B.] Stanford Univ, Woods Inst Environm, Dept Earth Syst Sci, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Jackson, Robert B.] Stanford Univ, Precourt Inst Energy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Poulter, Benjamin] NASA, Goddard Space Flight Ctr, Biospher Sci Lab, Greenbelt, MD USA; [Zhang, Zhen] Univ Maryland, Dept Geog Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hugelius, Gustaf] Stockholm Univ, Dept Phys Geog, Stockholm, Sweden; [Hugelius, Gustaf] Stockholm Univ, Bolin Ctr Climate Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Bousquet, Philippe; Saunois, Marielle] Univ Paris Saclay, CEA CNRS UVSQ, IPSL, LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Canadell, Josep G.] CSIRO, Global Carbon Project, Oceans & Atmosphere, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Papale, Dario; Trotta, Carlo] Univ Tuscia, Dipartimento Innovaz Nei Sistemi Biol Agroaliment, Viterbo, Italy; [Chu, Housen; Torn, Margaret S.; Dengel, Sigrid] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA USA; [Keenan, Trevor F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Earth & Environm Sci Area, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Keenan, Trevor F.; Baldocchi, Dennis; Chamberlain, Samuel] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Mammarella, Ivan; Vesala, Timo] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmospher & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Aurela, Mika; Lohila, Annalea; Peltola, Olli] Finnish Meteorol Inst, Helsinki, Finland; [Bohrer, Gil] Ohio State Univ, Dept Civil Environm & Geodet Engn, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Campbell, David, I] Univ Waikato, Sch Sci, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Cescatti, Alessandro; Goded, Ignacio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Ispra, Italy; [Chen, Jiquan] Michigan State, Dept Geog Environm & Spatial Sci, E Lansing, MI USA; [Chen, Jiquan] Michigan State, Ctr Global Change & Earth Observat, E Lansing, MI USA; [Chen, Weinan; Niu, Shuli] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Ecosyst Network Observat & Modeling, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Desai, Ankur R.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Madison, WI USA; [Euskirchen, Eugenie] Univ Alaska Fairbanks, Inst Arctic Biol, Fairbanks, AK USA; [Friborg, Thomas] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Geosci & Nat Resource Management, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Gasbarra, Daniele] Univ Napoli Federico II, Dept Vegetal Biol, Naples, Italy; [Gasbarra, Daniele] CNR, Inst Mediterranean Agr & Forest Syst, Naples, Italy; [Goeckede, Mathias; Heimann, Martin] Max Planck Inst Biogeochem, Jena, Germany; [Heimann, Martin] Univ Helsinki, Fac Sci, Inst Atmosphere & Earth Syst Res Phys, Helsinki, Finland; [Helbig, Manuel] McMaster Univ, Sch Geog & Earth Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Helbig, Manuel; Sonnentag, Oliver] Univ Montreal, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hirano, Takashi] Hokkaido Univ, Res Fac Agr, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Hollinger, David Y.] US Forest Serv, Northern Res Stn, USDA, Durham, NH USA; [Iwata, Hiroki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kang, Minseok] Natl Ctr Agro Meteorol, Seoul, South Korea; [Klatt, Janina] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Inst Meteorol & Climate Res, Garmisch Partenkirchen, Germany; [Krauss, Ken W.; Ward, Eric J.] US Geol Survey, Wetland & Aquat Res Ctr, Lafayette, LA USA; [Kutzbach, Lars] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Earth Syst Res & Sustainabil, Inst Soil Sci, Hamburg, Germany; [Mitra, Bhaskar; Noormets, Asko] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ecosyst Sci & Management, College Stn, TX USA; [Morin, Timothy H.] SUNY Coll Environm Sci & Forestry, Dept Environm Resources Engn, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA; [Nilsson, Mats B.; Peichl, Matthias] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Ecol & Management, Umea, Sweden; [Oechel, Walter C.; Zona, Donatella] San Diego State Univ, Dept Biol, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Oechel, Walter C.] Univ Exeter, Dept Phys Geog, Exeter, Devon, England; [Reba, Michele L.] ARS, Delta Water Management Res Serv, USDA, Jonesboro, AR USA; [Richardson, Andrew D.] No Arizona Univ, Sch Informat Comp & Cyber Syst, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Richardson, Andrew D.] No Arizona Univ, Ctr Ecosyst Sci & Soc, Flagstaff, AZ 86011 USA; [Runkle, Benjamin R.

The conventional exercise test with treadmill or cycle ergometer (CE) for assessing physical capacity, such as peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and anaerobic threshold (AT), is not always usable for older patients with T2DM. The incremental sit-to-stand (ISTS) exercise is an incremental exercise test using external signals to control the sit-to-stand rate in a given time frame and can be performed in a small space using only a chair. This study aimed to examine the validity of the physical capacity assessment during the ISTS exercise, based on the relationships between the ISIS performance, peak VO2, AT on ISTS exercise and CE test, in older patients with T2DM. Twenty-two patients with T2DM (10 men, 12 women; mean age, 68.0 years; range, 61-77 years) performed ISTS exercise (according to an existing protocol) and CE test in a randomized manner. Peak VO2, AT, and completion time were determined for the ISTS exercise and CE test. Peak VO2 during ISTS exercise was significantly associated with that during the CE test (r = 0.89, p < 0.01). The completion time on the ISTS exercise was significantly associated with peak VO2 (r = 0.80, p < 0.01) and AT on the ISIS exercise (r = 0.78, p < 0.01). The ISTS exercise is a useful tool to determine the physical capacity and estimate peak VO2 and AT in older people with T2DM.","[Nakamura, Keisuke; Nagasawa, Yuya] Matsumoto City Hosp, Dept Rehabil, 4417-180 Hata, Matsumoto, Nagano 3901401, Japan; [Sawaki, Shoji; Sato, Yoshihiko] Matsumoto City Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yokokawa, Yoshiharu] Shinshu Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Ohira, Masayoshi] Kanno Dialysis & Vasc Access Clin, Dept Rehabil, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Nakamura, K (reprint author), Matsumoto City Hosp, Dept Rehabil, 4417-180 Hata, Matsumoto, Nagano 3901401, Japan.",keipons55@yahoo.co.jp,,,Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for the promotion of medical sciences,"We are especially thankful to all the participants who cooperated in our study, as well as to the rehabilitation staff for their assistance in data collection for the study.

Effect of Co3+ ion substitution on structure, morphology and magnetic properties of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA), scanning and transmission electron spectroscopy (SEM and TEM), vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) and Mossbauer analyzer. All XRD patterns show the single phase spinel ferrite without any impurity. The crystallite size of the samples is within the range of 7.1-21.7 nm. FT-IR analysis showed that all products were successfully packed by OAm. Both SEM and TEM results confirmed that products have spherical morphology with small agglomeration. When Co3+ ions were substituted to the Fe3O4, Ms continued to decrease up to Co3+ content of y = 0.4. It was reported that Co3+ ions prefer to replace Fe2+ ions on octahedral side up to some concentration. Although the Mossbauer spectra for the all samples were composed of magnetic sextets, superparamagnetic particles are also formed for FeCo0.6Fe1.4O4, FeCo0.8Fe1.2O4 and FeCoFe2O4 samples.

However, the low intrinsic electrical conductivity of MoS2 limits its rate performance. Herein, we demonstrate that the electrical conductivity of MoS2 can be significantly improved by adding V atoms substitutionally via a two-step approach that includes the electrodeposition of amorphous MoS2 followed by a solid-state reaction that is able to crystallize the layered material and introduce V atoms into the MoS2 lattice. This approach also has the following advantages: (i) electrodeposition is a scalable process for synthesizing MoS2 films directly on the current collectors and (ii) amorphous electrodeposited MoS2 is prone to be doped with heteroatoms, thus allowing extensive V solubility ranging from 3.8 to 17.6 atom % in MoS2. This incorporation of vanadium (V 17.6 atom %) significantly reduces the band gap of MoS2 from 1.56 to 0.90 eV. The improvement in the electrical conductivity and Li-ion diffusion of V-MoS2 alloys also increases the retention capacity at high current densities (1000 mA g(-1)) by more than 4 times that of MoS2, with stable cyclability at both 200 and 1000 mAh g(-1). The improved rate performance and capacity retention of V-MoS2 indicate that transition-metal alloying offers a viable alternative strategy when designing high-performance LIB anodes.","[Lei, Yu; Zhang, Fu; Briggs, Natalie; Robinson, Joshua A.; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lei, Yu; Zhang, Fu; Briggs, Natalie; Robinson, Joshua A.; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lei, Yu; Fujisawa, Kazunori; Zhang, Fu; Robinson, Joshua A.; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Ctr Atomically Thin Multifunct Coatings, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Lei, Yu; Fujisawa, Kazunori; Zhang, Fu; Briggs, Natalie; Lin, Zhong; Robinson, Joshua A.; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Ctr 2 Dimens & Layered Mat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fujisawa, Kazunori; Yeh, Yin-Ting; Lin, Zhong; Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Aref, Amir Reza] Penn State Univ, Dept Engn Sci & Mech, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Yeh, Yin-Ting] Penn State Univ, Huck Inst Life Sci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Rajagopalan, Ramakrishnan] Penn State Univ, Dept Engn, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA; [Terrones, Mauricio] Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Mat Res Inst, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Ctr Atomically Thin Multifunct Coatings, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Ctr 2 Dimens & Layered Mat, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Chem, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Rajagopalan, R (reprint author), Penn State Univ, Dept Engn, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA.; Terrones, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",rur12@psu.edu; mut11@psu.edu,,,NSF-IUCRC Center for AtomiCAy.

Methods: We evaluated the prognosis of NETs according to the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system, compared the clinical response to different chemotherapy regimens, and compared different histological subtypes of NETS. Results: Diagnoses of the subjects were atypical carcinoid tumor (ACT, n = 37), small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC, n = 126), large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC, n = 22), and NET, not elsewhere classified (n = 8), according to central pathological review. According to FIGO 2018, 69, 17, 74, and 33 patients were at stage 1, II, Ill, or IV, respectively. Five-year survival was 64.5%, 50.1%, 30.2%, and 3.4% for patients at stage I, II, Ill and IV. About 40% of patients with stage IIIC1 survived >5 years. On multivariate analyses, locally-advanced disease, para-aortic node metastasis, distant metastasis, and <4 cycles of chemotherapy were associated with poor survival. Histological subtype and pelvic node metastasis had no prognostic significance. Response rates to etoposide-platinum (EP) or irinotecan-platinum (CPT-P) regimens were 43.8% (28/64), but only 12.9% to a taxane-platinum (TC) regimen (4/31). The response rate for ACT was 8.7% (2/23), significantly less than the 36.6% for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HGNEC: both SCNEC and LCNEC, 41/111). Conclusions: Locally-advanced, extra-pelvic disease and insufficient chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors for cervical NET. HGNEC showed good responses to EP or CPT-P but not TC. Chemotherapy was less effective for ACT, which had a prognosis identical to HGNEC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, as far as we are concerned, comprehensive research to compare modes of action between different silver species at identical silver contents has not yet been reported. The activities of silver species at the interfaces of nanofiber scaffolds and bacterial medium under the impediment of chloride salt, present in antibacterial assays, are very complicated and could bring deeper understanding for research upon antibacterial applications using silver. Here, we prepared silver nitrate, silver zero-valent nanoparticles, and silver monovalent nanoparticles, incorporated in the nanofiber scaffolds at similar silver contents, then, compared all samples regarding antibacterial effects and fibroblast cytotoxicity. For confirming the success of fabrication, SEM, TEM, EDS, and FT-IR were implemented. Silver nanoparticles were observed to adhere on the nanofibers for Ag2O-PAN 1/20, Ag2O-PAN 1/5, Ag-PAN 1/20, and Ag-PAN 1/5 samples. The XRD spectra exhibited different sets of peaks for zerovalent and monovalent silver nanoparticles, which gave evidence about the nature of silver species incorporated in nanofibers. The XPS data gave an insight into the interactions between silver and the other molecules in the polymer matrix. The antibacterial evaluation gave the demonstration for theories about silver actions in the bacterial medium with the presence of halide anions, which sabotaged the antibacterial actions of silver nitrate and made it the least potent antibacterial agent among different silver species.","[Duy-Nam Phan; Saito, Yusuke; Kim, Ick-Soo] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, ICCER, Div Frontier Fibers,Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Dorjjugder, Nasanjargal; Taguchi, Goro] Shinshu Univ, Gene Res Ctr, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Lee, Hoik] Korea Inst Ind Technol, 143 Hanggaul Ro, Ansan 15588, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Lee, Jung Soon] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Clothing & Text, Daejeon 34134, South Korea","Kim, IS (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, ICCER, Div Frontier Fibers,Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Lee, JS (reprint author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Clothing & Text, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.",jungsoon@cnu.ac.kr; kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korea government [NRF-2017R1A2B4009315]","This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning of the Korea government.

It also contains an isosaponarin, 40-O-glucosyl-6-C-glucosyl apigenin, in its leaves, which has received increasing attention in recent years for its bioactivity, such as its promotion of type-I collagen production. However, its biosynthetic enzymes have not been clarified. In this study, we partially purified a C-glucosyltransferase (CGT) involved in isosaponarin biosynthesis from wasabi leaves and identified the gene coding for it (WjGT1). The encoded protein was similar to UGT84 enzymes and was named UGT84A57. The recombinant enzyme of WjGT1 expressed in Escherichia coli showed C-glucosylation activity toward the 6-position of flavones such as apigenin and luteolin. The enzyme also showed significant activity toward flavonols, but trace or no activity toward flavone 40-O-glucosides, suggesting that isosaponarin biosynthesis in wasabi plants would proceed by 6-C-glucosylation of apigenin, followed by its 40-O-glucosylation. Interestingly, the enzyme showed no activity against sinapic acid or p-coumaric acid, which are usually the main substrates of UGT84 enzymes. The accumulation of WjGT1 transcripts was observed mainly in the leaves and flowers of wasabi, in which C-glucosylflavones were accumulated. Molecular phylogenetic analysis suggested thatWjGT1 acquired C-glycosylation activity independently from other reported CGTs after the differentiation of the family Brassicaceae.","[Mashima, Kyoko; Hatano, Mayu; Shimosaka, Makoto; Taguchi, Goro] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Biol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Suzuki, Hideyuki] Kazusa DNA Res Inst, Dept Appl Genom, Kisarazu 2920818, Japan","Taguchi, G (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Appl Biol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",gtagtag@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP26450120]",This work was supported in part by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI [grant number JP26450120 to G.T.].,,35,1,1,17,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0032-0781,1471-9053,,PLANT CELL PHYSIOL,Plant Cell Physiol.,DEC,2019,60,12,,,SI,,2733,2743,,10.1093/pcp/pcz164,,,11,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,Plant Sciences; Cell Biology,JZ2HH,WOS:000504924100013,31418788,,,,2020/4/20

Background: Two-thirds of patients with NSCLC are >= 65 years of age. As age increases, the risk of competing events, such as noncancer death, also increases. Methods: Elderly patients (>= 65 yrs of age) who have undergone curative-intent lobectomy for stage I-III NSCLC without induction therapy (2002-2013) were included (n=1,303). Of those, 607 patients had undergone MIS and 696 had undergone thoracotomy. Propensity-score matching was performed to identify pairs of thoracotomy and MIS patients with comparable clinical characteristics (eg, year of surgery, comorbidities, and pulmonary function). Association between surgical approach (MIS vs thoracotomy) and lung cancer-specific and noncancer-specific cumulative incidence of death (CID) was analyzed using competing risks approach. Results: Following propensity score matching of patients who had undergone thoracotomy (n=338) versus MIS (n=338), MIS was associated with shorter length of stay (P <0.001), lower noncancer-specific 1-year mortality (P=0.027), and lower noncancer-specific CID (P=0.014) compared with thoracotomy; there was no difference in lung cancer-specific CID between surgical approaches. On multivariable analysis, thoracotomy was a significant risk factor for noncancer-specific death (subhazard ratio 2.45, 95% CI 1.18-5.06, P=0.016) independent of age, sex, and diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. Conclusion: In a propensity score-matched cohort, multivariable analysis has indicated that lobectomy performed by MIS is associated with lower incidence of noncancer-specific mortality compared with lobectomy performed by open thoracotomy in elderly patients with NSCLC.","[Hristov, Boris; Eguchi, Takashi; Bains, Sarina; Dycoco, Joe; Isbell, James M.; Park, Bernard J.; Jones, David R.; Adusumilli, Prasad S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Thorac Serv, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA; [Eguchi, Takashi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Surg, Div Thorac Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tan, Kay See] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Adusumilli, Prasad S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ctr Cell Engn, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA","Adusumilli, PS (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Thorac Serv, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.; Adusumilli, PS (reprint author), Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Cellular Therapeut Ctr, Solid Tumors Cell Therapy, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10065 USA.",adusumip@mskcc.org,,,"National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [R01 CA217169, P30 CA008748]; U.S. Department of DefenseUnited States Department of Defense [BC132124, LC160212]; Derfner Foundation; Joanne and John DallePezze Foundation; Commonwealth Foundation for Cancer Research; Experimental Therapeutics Center of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center","The authors' laboratory research is supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01 CA217169 to D.R.J., P30 CA008748 to P.S.A.); the U.S. Department of Defense (BC132124 and LC160212 to P.S.A.); the Derfner Foundation; the Joanne and John DallePezze Foundation; Mr. William H.

Constitutive activation by the disruption of autoinhibitory interactions between the N-terminal diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID) and C-terminal diaphanous autoregulatory domain (DAD) dysregulates DIA1, resulting in both hearing loss and blood cell abnormalities. Methods and results Here, we report the first constitutively active mutant in the DID (p.A265S) of humans with only hearing loss and not blood cell abnormality through whole exome sequencing. The previously reported DAD mutants and our DID mutant (p.A265S) shared the finding of diminished autoinhibitory interaction, abnormally upregulated actin polymerisation activity and increased localisations at the plasma membrane. However, the obvious defect in the DIA1-driven assembly of cytoskeleton 'during cell division' was only from the DAD mutants, not from p.A265S, which did not show any blood cell abnormality. We also evaluated the five DID mutants in the hydrophobic pocket since four of these five additional mutants were predicted to critically disrupt interaction between the DID and DAD. These additional pathogenic DID mutants revealed varying degrees of defect in the DIA1-driven cytoskeleton assembly, including nearly normal phenotype during cell division as well as obvious impaired autoinhibition, again coinciding with our key observation in DIA1 mutant (p.A265S) in the DID. Conclusion Here, we report the first mutant in the DID of humans with only hearing loss. The differential cell biological phenotypes of DIA1 during cell division appear to be potential determinants of the clinical severity of DIAPH1-related cytoskeletopathy in humans.","[Kim, Bong Jik] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Coll Med, Daejeon, South Korea; [Ueyama, Takehiko] Kobe Univ, Biosignal Res Ctr, Mol Pharmacol Lab, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Miyoshi, Takushi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Otolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Kyoto 6068507, Japan; [Miyoshi, Takushi] Natl Inst Deafness & Other Commun Disorders, Lab Mol Genet, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA; [Lee, Seungmin; Han, Jin Hee; Park, Hye-Rim; Oh, Jayoung; Kim, Min Young; Kang, Yong Seok; Oh, Doo Yi; Choi, Byung Yoon] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Med, Bundang Hosp, Dept Otorhinolaryngol Head & Neck Surg, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Ah Reum; Kim, Nayoung K.

With increasing treatment temperature, carbon accumulation appears on the a-C film surfaces; the lamellar crystals disappear when the treatment temperature reaches 1200 degrees C, and flowing sand-like stacking is apparent on the film surfaces. With the deepening of the heat-treatment process, the columnar cross-sectional structure of the a-C films disappears.

Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a 37-amino acid peptide produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcript of the calcitonin/CGRP gene (Caka). CGRP was initially identified as a neuropeptide released primarily from sensory nerves and involved in regulating pathophysiological nociceptive pain. However, recent studies have shown CGRP is also released from a variety of other cells and possesses multiple functions. In this study, CGRP knockout (-/-) mice were used to show the actions of endogenous CGRP in postoperative lymphedema. After generating a mouse postoperative tail lymphedema model, the edema was observed to be more severe in CGRP (-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. Numbers of lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE-1)-positive lymphatic capillaries were decreased and lymphatic capillary formation-related factors were down-regulated in CGRP(-/-) mice. In addition, accumulation of M2 but not M1 macrophages was selectively reduced in the edematous tissue of CGRP(-/-) mice. Selective depletion of M2 macrophages decreased lymphatic capillary formation and worsened lymphedema in wild-type mice but not CGRP(-/-) mice, where numbers of M2 macrophages were already diminished. These findings suggest that endogenous CGRP acts to ameliorate postoperative lymphedema by enhancing Lymphatic capillary formation and that M2 macrophages play critical roles. CGRP may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of postoperative lymphedema.","[Matsui, Shuhei; Tanaka, Megumu; Kamiyoshi, Akiko; Sakurai, Takayuki; Ichikawa-Shindo, Yuka; Kawate, Hisaka; Dai, Kun; Cui, Nanqi; Wei, Yangxuan; Tanaka, Masaaki; Kakihara, Shinji; Nakamura, Keisei; Yamauchi, Akihiro; Shindo, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Res, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Matsui, Shuhei; Ishida, Kumiko; Tanaka, Satoshi; Kawamata, Mikito] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tanaka, Masaaki; Kakihara, Shinji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Ophthalmol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tanaka, Megumu; Kamiyoshi, Akiko; Shindo, Takayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Life Innovat, Inst Biomed Sci, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Shindo, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Cardiovasc Res, Asahi 3-1-1, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tshindo@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); Bristol-Myers Squibb CompanyBristol-Myers Squibb; Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology; Naito FoundationNaito Memorial Foundation; Public Foundation of Chubu Science and Technology Center; Yamaguchi Endocrine Research Foundation; Hoyu Science Foundation; Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation; Akaeda Medical Research FoundationMedical Research Council UK (MRC); Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medial Sciences; Japan Heart Foundation,"Supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI); Core Research for Evolutionary Science and Technology (CREST) of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED); and research grants from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology, the Naito Foundation, the Public Foundation of Chubu Science and Technology Center, Yamaguchi Endocrine Research Foundation, Hoyu Science Foundation, Takahashi Industrial and Economic Research Foundation, Akaeda Medical Research Foundation, Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for Promotion of Medial Sciences, and Japan Heart Foundation (all to T.Sh.).",,46,0,0,3,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0002-9440,1525-2191,,AM J PATHOL,Am.

Concentrations of MC variants (MC-LR, -RR, and -YR) in the multimedia samples were analyzed using a HPLCMS/MS. Trophic position (TP) of organisms (fish, bivalve, gastropod, decapod, and polychaete) was determined by nitrogen stable isotope analyses of both bulk tissues and amino acids. From July to August 2017, great concentrations of MCs were detected in discharged freshwater ranging from 0.4 to 75 mu g L-1. Considerable amounts of MCs are delivered to the Geum River Estuary in summer season. MCs spread far away as dissolved phases (18.7-49.5 mu g L-1) in July when large amount of freshwater was discharged during the rainy season. Concentrations of MCs in marine organisms varied among species, ranging from 40 to 870 mu g g(-1) dw. Bioaccumulated MCs tend to decrease with increasing TP of organisms, suggesting that MCs are biodiluted through the marine food web. Compound-specific isotope analysis (nitrogen of amino acids) provides more reliable TPs compared with those by bulk isotope analysis in a closed estuary (such as the Geum River Estuary) with large fluctuations in the isotope ratio of primary producers.","[Kim, Dokyun; Choi, Hyuntae; Choi, Bohyung; Shin, Kyung-Hoon] Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergence Engn, Ansan, South Korea; [Hong, Seongjin] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Ocean Environm Sci, Daejeon, South Korea; [Choi, Bohyung] Hokkaido Univ, Inst Low Temp Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Kim, Jaeseong] Water & Ecobio Co Ltd, Jungboo Bldg, Kunsan, South Korea; [Khim, Jong Seong] Seoul Natl Univ, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Seoul, South Korea; [Khim, Jong Seong] Seoul Natl Univ, Res Inst Oceanog, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Hodong] Shinshu Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Fac Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Shin, KH (reprint author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Marine Sci & Convergence Engn, Ansan, South Korea.; Hong, S (reprint author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Ocean Environm Sci, Daejeon, South Korea.",hongseongjin@cnu.ac.kr; shinkh@hanyang.ac.kr,"Khim, Jong Seong/AAD-3054-2020; Hong, Seongjin/B-5933-2013","Khim, Jong Seong/0000-0001-7977-0929; Hong, Seongjin/0000-0002-6305-8731","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT) [NRF-2016R1E1A1A01943004, 2017R1A4A1015393]",This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (Ministry of Science and ICT) (No. NRF-2016R1E1A1A01943004 & No. 2017R1A4A1015393).,,64,0,0,6,6,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

From a retrospective cohort (n = 873) from the Japan PBC Study Group, we enrolled 118 patients who had received UDCA monotherapy for at least 1 year followed by combination therapy with UDCA+BF for at least 1 year. GLOBE and UK-PBC scores after UDCA monotherapy (i.e., immediately before UDCA+BF combination therapy) were compared with those after 1 year of UDCA+BF combination therapy. The real outcomes of enrolled patients estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis were compared with the predicted outcomes calculated using GLOBE and UK-PBC scores. In addition, the hazard ratio of BF treatment was calculated using propensity score analysis. The mean GLOBE score before the combination therapy was 0.504 +/- 0.080, which improved significantly to 0.115 +/- 0.085 (P < 0.0001) after 1 year of combination therapy. The real liver transplant-free survival of enrolled patients was significantly better than that predicted by GLOBE score before introducing BF. Combination therapy did not significantly improve the real rates of liver transplantation or liver-related death compared with those predicted by UK-PBC risk score before introducing BF, but the predicted risk was significantly reduced by the addition of BF (P < 0.0001). Cox regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting showed that the addition of BF significantly reduced the hazard of liver transplant or liver-related death in patients who, after 1 year of UDCA monotherapy, had normal serum bilirubin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.60, P = 0.013). Conclusion: Addition of BF to UDCA monotherapy improves not only GLOBE and UK-PBC scores but also the long-term prognosis of PBC patients, especially those with early-stage PBC.","[Honda, Akira; Matsuzaki, Yasushi] Tokyo Med Univ, Ibaraki Med Ctr, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Ibaraki, Japan; [Tanaka, Atsushi; Takikawa, Hajime] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Kaneko, Tetsuji; Iimuro, Satoshi] Teikyo Univ, Teikyo Acad Res Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Komori, Atsumasa] Natl Hosp Org NHO Nagasaki Med Ctr, Clin Res Ctr, Nagasaki, Japan; [Abe, Masanori] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Metabol, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Inao, Mie; Mochida, Satoshi] Saitama Med Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Saitama, Japan; [Namisaki, Tadashi; Yoshiji, Hitoshi] Nara Med Univ, Dept Internal Med 3, Nara, Japan; [Hashimoto, Naoaki] Tokyo Teishin Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Tokyo, Japan; [Kawata, Kazuhito] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Hepatol Div, Dept Internal Med, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Takahashi, Atsushi; Ohira, Hiromasa] Fukushima Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Fukushima, Japan; [Ninomiya, Masashi] Tohoku Univ, Div Gastroenterol, Grad Sch Med, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kang, Jong-Hon] Teine Keijinkai Hosp, Ctr Gastroenterol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Arakawa, Mie] Oita Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Fac Med, Yufu City, Japan; [Yamagiwa, Satoshi] Niigata Univ, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Niigata, Japan; [Joshita, Satoru; Umemura, Takeji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Sato, Ken] Gunma Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Maebashi, Gumma, Japan; [Kaneko, Akira] NTT West Osaka Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Osaka, Japan; [Kikuchi, Kentaro] Teikyo Univ, Mizonokuchi Hosp, Dept Internal Med 4, Sagamiko, Kanagawa, Japan; [Itakura, Jun] Musashino Red Cross Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Tokyo, Japan; [Nomura, Takako; Masaki, Tsutomu] Kagawa Univ, Dept Gastroenterol & Neurol, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan; [Kakisaka, Keisuke; Takikawa, Yasuhiro] Iwate Med Univ, Div Hepatol, Dept Internal Med, Morioka, Iwate, Japan; [Fujii, Hideki; Kawada, Norifumi] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Hepatol, Osaka, Japan","Tanaka, A (reprint author), Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Itabashi Ku, 2-11-1 Kaga, Tokyo 1738605, Japan.",a-tanaka@med.teikyo-u.ac.jp,,"Honda, Akira/0000-0003-0902-8272","Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant]",,,48,7,7,0,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0270-9139,1527-3350,,HEPATOLOGY,Hepatology,DEC,2019,70,6,,,,,2035,2046,,10.1002/hep.30552,,,12,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,Gastroenterology & Hepatology,JT2KF,WOS:000500824000013,30737815,,,,2020/4/20

Increasing congestion situations constantly require urbanists to enhance traffic fluidity, while limiting pollutant emissions and vehicle consumption to improve inhabitants' welfare. Various mono or multi-objective optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy logic algorithms or even particle swarm optimizations, help to reach optimal traffic signal settings. However, those methods are usually designed to tackle very specific transportation configurations. Here, we introduce an extended version of the sialac benchmark, bringing together several realworld-like study cases with various features related to population, working activities, or traffic light devices. We drive a fitness landscape analysis on these various benchmark instances, which helps to improve the design of optimization algorithms for this class of real-world mobility problems. Thereby, we propose a new adaptive optimization algorithm to tackle each scenario of the benchmark. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: We retrospectively collected data on 2,668 patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy of nonmetastatic upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in 1995 to 2009. We evaluated the impact of bladder cancer on overall mortality and the factors predictive of subsequent bladder cancer. Results: A total of 631 patients (23.7%) had previous or simultaneous bladder cancer. Patients with previous or simultaneous bladder cancer had significantly shorter overall survival than patients without previous or simultaneous bladder cancer (HR 1.29, 95% CI 1.09-1.53, p = 0.0026). Of the 2,037 patients without previous or simultaneous bladder cancer 683 (33.5%) subsequently had bladder cancer after radical nephroureterectomy. Of patients with pT0-2 disease those with subsequent bladder cancer had significantly shorter overall survival than patients without subsequent bladder cancer (HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.23-2.67, p = 0.0025). In patients with pT3-4 disease subsequent bladder cancer was not associated with worse overall survival. On multivariable analyses independent predictors of subsequent bladder cancer were gender, preoperative urine cytology and clinical node status in the preoperative setting, and gender, adjuvant chemotherapy and pathological node status in the postoperative setting. Conclusions: Bladder cancer was significantly associated with worse clinical outcomes after radical nephroureterectomy of upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. Preventing subsequent bladder cancer in patients with pT0-2 upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma may lead to better prognosis in those who undergo radical nephroureterectomy.","[Kuroiwa, Kentaro] Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hosp, Dept Urol, Miyazaki, Japan; [Inokuchi, Junichi; Eto, Masatoshi; Naito, Seiji] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Nishiyama, Hiroyuki; Kojima, Takahiro] Univ Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Kakehi, Yoshiyuki; Sugimoto, Mikio] Kagawa Univ, Fac Med, Takamatsu, Kagawa, Japan; [Tanigawa, Toshiki] Niigata Canc Ctr Hosp, Niigata, Japan; [Gotoh, Momokazu] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Masumori, Naoya] Sapporo Med Univ, Sch Med, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ogawa, Osamu] Kyoto Univ, Kyoto, Japan; [Ohyama, Chikara] Hirosaki Univ, Grad Sch Med, Hirosaki, Aomori, Japan; [Yokomizo, Akira; Naito, Seiji] Harasanshin Hosp, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Matsuyama, Hideyasu] Yamaguchi Univ, Grad Sch Med, Ube, Yamaguchi, Japan; [Ichikawa, Tomohiko] Chiba Univ, Grad Sch Med, Chiba, Japan; [Mizusawa, Junki; Eba, Junko] Natl Canc Ctr, Urol Div, Tokyo, Japan; [Mizusawa, Junki; Eba, Junko] Japan Clin Oncol Grp Data Ctr, Operat Off, Natl Canc Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Shinohara, N.] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Urol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Ito, A.] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Urol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Kawamura, S.] Miyagi Canc Ctr, Dept Urol, Natori, Miyagi, Japan; [Habuchi, T.] Akita Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Urol, Akita, Japan; [Tsuchiya, N.] Yamagata Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, Yamagata, Japan; [Egawa, S.] Natl Def Med Coll, Dept Urol, Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan; [Egawa, S.] Jikei Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakagawa, T.] Teikyo Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Tokyo, Japan; [Iwamura, M.] Kitasato Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan; [Ishi-Zuka, O.] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Miyake, H.] Hamamatsu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; [Niwakawa, M.] Shizuoka Canc Ctr, Div Urol, Shizuoka, Japan; [Sugimura, Y.] Mie Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Nephrourol Surg & Androl, Tsu, Mie, Japan; [Nishumura, K.] Osaka Med Ctr Canc & Cardiovasc Dis, Dept Urol, Osaka, Japan; [Fujimoto, K.] Nara Med Univ, Dept Urol, Kashihara, Nara, Japan; [Takenaka, A.] Tottori Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg, Div Urol, Yonago, Tottori, Japan; [Hashine, K.] Natl Hosp Org, Shikoku Canc Ctr Hosp, Dept Urol, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Kamba, T.] Kumamoto Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Urol, Kumamoto, Japan","Naito, S (reprint author), Harasanshin Hosp, Dept Urol, Hakata Ku, 1-8 Taihakumachi, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8120033, Japan.",naito@harasanshin.or.jp,"Matsuyama, Hideyasu/AAC-7487-2020","Matsuyama, Hideyasu/0000-0001-5607-7769","National Cancer Center Research and Development FundNational Cancer Center - Japan [23-A-20, 26-A-4, 29-A-3]; JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K11010]","Supported in part by the National Cancer Center Research and Development Fund (23-A-20, 26-A-4, 29-A-3) and JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP16K11010.",,28,0,0,3,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0022-5347,1527-3792,,J UROLOGY,J.

Participants and Methods: Men and women (N=679; mean age, 65 +/- 7 SD years) completed 5-month IWT. Participants were instructed to repeat 5 or more sets of fast and slow walking for 3 minutes each at 70% or more and 40% e(V) over dot O-2peak for walking, respectively, per day for 4 or more d/wk. This study was conducted from April 1, 2005, through February 29, 2008. Results: Interval walking training increased e(V) over dot O-2peak by 14% and decreased LSD score by 17% on average (P<.001). During 5-month IWT, fast and slow walking times were 88 +/- 65 SD and 100 +/- 86 min/wk, respectively, but varied among participants. We divided participants into approximately 10 bins for 6 minutes each of fast and slow walking times per week up to 60 min/wk, and above this time, approximately 8 bins for 30 or 60 minutes each of fast and slow walking up to the maximal time. We found that both e(V) over dot O-2peak and LSD score improved as fast walking time per week increased up to 50 min/wk (R-2 =0.94; P<.001 for e(V) over dot O-2peak; R-2 =0.51; P=.03 for LSDS) but plateaued above this time. In contrast, improvement in neither e(V) over dotO(2peak) nor LSDS was positively correlated with slow or total walking time per week. Multiple regression analyses confirmed that fast walking time per week was the major determinant of improvements in e(V) over dotO(2peak) (P<.001) and LSD score (P=.001). Conclusion: High-intensity walking time during IWT is a key factor to increase e(V) over dot O-2peak and decrease LSD score in middle-aged and older people.

This study evaluated long-term outcomes of patients who underwent ESD for EGC without curative resection according to hospital volumes in Japan. Methods This multicenter retrospective study evaluated 1,969 patients who did not meet the criteria of the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association for curative resection between January 2000 and August 2011. Hospitals were classified according to the annual number of ESD procedures: low- and medium-volume group (LMVG), high-volume group (HVG), and very high-volume group (VHVG). Clinicopathological features, overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were compared across groups after a generalized propensity score matching analysis. Results In 495 pairs of generalized propensity score-matched patients, the 5-year OS, DSS, and RFS rates were 81.5%, 97.9%, and 97.6% for LMVG; 86.9%, 98.2%, and 97.0% for HVG; and 85.4%, 98.5%, and 97.6% for VHVG, respectively. The 5-year DSS and RFS rates did not significantly differ among the three groups. However, 5-year OS was significantly worse in the LMVG than in the HVG and VHVG (P<0.001 and P=0.008, respectively). Conclusions DSS and RFS in patients with EGC who did not meet the criteria for curative resection did not differ across hospital volumes in Japan. Even in cases in which ESD for EGC involved non-curative resection, the procedure is feasible across Japanese hospitals with different volumes.","[Dohi, Osamu; Naito, Yuji] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Kyoto, Japan; [Hatta, Waku; Shimosegawa, Tooru] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Aoba Ku, 1-1 Seiryo Machi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan; [Gotoda, Takuji; Esaki, Mitsuru] Nihon Univ, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Oyama, Tsuneo; Takahashi, Akiko] Saku Cent Hosp Adv Care Ctr, Div Endoscopy, Nagano, Japan; [Kawata, Noboru] Shizuoka Canc Ctr, Div Endoscopy, Shizuoka, Japan; [Oka, Shiro] Hiroshima Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Metab, Hiroshima, Japan; [Hoteya, Shu] Toranomon Gen Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakagawa, Masahiro] Hiroshima City Hosp, Dept Endoscopy, Hiroshima, Japan; [Hirano, Masaaki] Niigata Prefectural Cent Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Joetsu, Japan; [Esaki, Mitsuru] Kitakyushu Municipal Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan; [Matsuda, Mitsuru] Toyama Prefectural Cent Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Toyama, Japan; [Ohnita, Ken] Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Nagasaki, Japan; [Shimoda, Ryo] Saga Med Sch, Dept Internal Med & Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Saga, Japan; [Yoshida, Motoyuki] Nara Med Univ, Dept Gastroenterol & Endocrinol & Metab, Nara, Japan; [Takada, Jun] Gifu Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Grad Sch Med, Gifu, Japan; [Tanaka, Keiko] Shinshu Univ, Dept Gastroenterol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yamada, Shinya] Japanese Red Cross Soc Kyoto Daiichi Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Kyoto, Japan; [Tsuji, Tsuyotoshi] Akita City Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Akita, Japan; [Ito, Hirotaka] Osaki Citizen Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Osaki, Japan; [Aoyagi, Hiroyuki] Fukui Prefectural Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Fukui, Japan","Hatta, W (reprint author), Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Aoba Ku, 1-1 Seiryo Machi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan.",waku-style@festa.ocn.ne.jp,"Dohi, Osamu/AAA-1634-2020","Dohi, Osamu/0000-0002-0498-0144",,,,24,1,1,4,4,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0930-2794,1432-2218,,SURG ENDOSC,Surg.

This study sought to identify the predictors of an unacceptable increase in MT curve (UIMT) after selective posterior fusion (SPF) of the TL/L curve in patients with Lenke type 5C adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). METHODS Forty-eight consecutive patients (44 females and 4 males, mean age 15.7 +/- 2.5 years, range 13-24 years) with Lenke type 5C AIS who underwent SPF of the TL/L curve were analyzed. The novel ""Shinshu line"" (S-line) was defined as a line connecting the centers of the concave-side pedicles of the upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) and lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) on preoperative radiographs. The authors established an S-line tilt to the right as S-line positive (S-line+, i.e., the UIV being to the right of the LIV) and compared S-line+ and S-line- groups for thoracic apical vertebral translation (T-AVT) and MT Cobb angle preoperatively, early postoperatively, and at final follow-up. The predictors for T-AVT > 20 mm at final follow-up were evaluated as well. T-AVT > 20 mm was defined as a UIMT. RESULTS Among the 48 consecutively treated patients, 26 were S-line+ and 22 were S-line-. At preoperative, early postoperative, and final follow-up a minimum of 2 years later, the mean T-AVT was 12.8 mm (range -9.3 to 32.8 mm), 19.6 mm (range -13.0 to 41.0 mm), and 22.8 mm (range -1.9 to 68.7 mm) in the S-line+ group, and 10.8 mm (range -5.1 to 27.3 mm), 16.2 mm (range -11.7 to 42.1 mm), and 11.0 mm (range -6.3 to 26.9 mm) in the S-line- group, respectively. T-AVT in S-line+ patients was significantly larger than that in S-line- patients at the final follow-up. Multivariate analysis revealed S-line+ (odds ratio [OR] 23.8, p = 0.003) and preoperative MT Cobb angle (OR 7.9, p = 0.001) to be predictors of a UIMT. CONCLUSIONS S-line+ was defined as the UIV being to the right of the LIV. T-AVT in the S-line+ group was significantly larger than in the S-line- group at the final follow-up. S-line+ status and larger preoperative MT Cobb angle were independent predictors of a UIMT after SPF for the TL/L curve in patients with Lenke type 5C AIS. Surgeons should consider changing the UIV and/or LIV in patients exhibiting S-line+ during preoperative planning to avoid a possible increase in MT curve and revision surgery.","[Oba, Hiroki; Takahashi, Jun; Ikegami, Shota; Kuraishi, Shugo; Uehara, Masashi; Takizawa, Takashi; Munakata, Ryo; Hatakenaka, Terue; Kato, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Nagano, Japan; [Kobayashi, Sho; Matsuyama, Yukihiro] Hamamatsu Univ Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Shizuoka, Japan; [Ohba, Tetsuro; Ebata, Shigeto; Haro, Hirotaka] Univ Yamanashi, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Yamanashi, Japan; [Koseki, Michihiko] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Nagano, Japan","Takahashi, J (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Nagano, Japan.",jtaka@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,25,0,0,0,1,AMER ASSOC NEUROLOGICAL SURGEONS,ROLLING MEADOWS,"5550 MEADOWBROOK DRIVE, ROLLING MEADOWS, IL 60008 USA",1547-5654,1547-5646,,J NEUROSURG-SPINE,J.

This East Asian group forms a sister group with previously known European and North American haplotype groups (i.e., the clade CT1 to CT3). The present phylogenetic analysis further revealed the occurrence of two described species (C. dipterum and Cloeon ryogokuensis) and possibly three species (Cloeon sp. 1 to 3) in Japan.

Methods A total of 101 consecutive patients who underwent posterior spinal fusion for AIS and who were followed for a minimum of 2 years were included in this investigation. We assessed Lenke curve type, age, Risser grade, body mass index (BMI), radiographic parameters, lumbar disc degeneration, correction rate, number of fused vertebrae, lowest instrumented vertebra, preoperative SRS-22r survey mental health score, and pre- and postoperative SRS-22r survey pain scores. Univariate and multivariate general linear models were employed to identify factors associated with pain 2 years after AIS surgery. Results In multivariate analysis, patients with a lower preoperative pain score (i.e. higher pain) (P < 0.01) or higher postoperative T5-12 kyphotic angle (P = 0.02) had a worsened pain score 2 years after surgery. There were no remarkable differences for Lenke curve type, age, BMI, coronal radiographic parameters, lumbar disc degeneration, correction rate, number of fused vertebrae, or lowest instrumented vertebra. Higher preoperative Risser grade (P = 0.01) and lower preoperative SRS-22r mental health score (P < 0.01) were significantly related to a diminished preoperative SRS-22r pain score. Conclusion While preoperative lumbar disc degeneration was not associated with pre- or postoperative pain in AIS, higher preoperative pain and higher postoperative T5-12 kyphotic angle had significant associations with augmented postoperative pain. Higher preoperative pain was related to increased Risser grade and lower mental health score.

The patient was a 12-year-old girl with MPS-I who underwent posterior spinal fusion with an all pedicle screw construct from T9 to L4 for a preoperative TL curve Cobb angle of 50 degrees and TL kyphotic angle of 71 degrees. Postoperative Cobb angle of the TL curve and TL kyphotic angle improved to 5 and 12 degrees, respectively. Although her lumbar lordosis decreased slightly due to mild back-out of the pedicle screws in L4, bony union was achieved 3 years after surgery without perioperative complications.

We described the effectiveness of surgical and radiation therapy in a case of recurrent hemangioma in the thoracic spine with extraosseous extension causing progressive paraparesis. We retrospectively reviewed a case of vertebral recurrent hemangioma treated by posterior spinal decompression and fusion and subsequent radiation therapy. A 61-year-old woman suffered from neurological deficits caused by a hemangioma in the thoracic spine. Despite initial treatment by posterior decompression, subtotal transpedicular tumor resection, and posterior spinal fusion, her neurological symptoms due to tumor compression recurred 5 years later. Posterior-approach anterior spinal cord decompression by subtotal transpedicular tumor resection was attempted next but her paraparesis continued to worsen. Radiotherapy of a total of 32 Gy in 16 fractions restored mobility and lesion size was markedly reduced 7 months later. Even 14 months after surgery, she has been able to walk although she has slightly paralysis of the lower extremity remaining. Subtotal transpedicular tumor resection, and especially additional radiation therapy, was effective in reducing tumor volume and improving neurological dysfunction caused by a thoracic spine recurrent hemangioma.","[Uehara, Masashi; Takahashi, Jun; Kuraishi, Shugo; Ikegami, Shota; Futatsugi, Toshimasa; Oba, Hiroki; Takizawa, Takashi; Kato, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Koiwai, Keiichirou] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Otsuki, Toshiaki; Uehara, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Lab Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Takahashi, J (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Orthopaed Surg, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",jtaka@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2214-7519,,,INTERDISCIP NEUROSUR,Interdiscip.

Simulation studies clarified the behavior of the resonance modes and the physical mechanism underpinning the transmission disappearance by the lateral displacement. Furthermore, we determined that the critical frequency, above which the even-order modes exhibit blue-shifts with increases in the air gap spacing, can be predicted very accurately using a simple equation including the lateral displacement. Additionally, the transmission characteristics assessed experimentally were compared with the simulation results. The geometrically-tunable unique optical characteristics are expected to promote the future applications of artificial dielectrics operating in low-frequency optical regions.","[Tokuda, Yasunori; Sakaguchi, Koichiro; Watanabe, Shogo] Okayama Prefectural Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Syst Engn, Okayama 7191197, Japan; [Kato, Kosaku; Nakajima, Makoto] Osaka Univ, Inst Laser Engn, Suita, Osaka 5650871, Japan; [Takano, Keisuke] Shinshu Univ, Ctr Energy & Environm Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Akiyama, Koichi] Mitsubishi Electr Corp, Adv Technol R&D Ctr, Amagasaki, Hyogo 6618661, Japan","Tokuda, Y (reprint author), Okayama Prefectural Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Syst Engn, Okayama 7191197, Japan.",tokuda@c.oka-pu.ac.jp,"Nakajima, Makoto/A-1333-2016","Nakajima, Makoto/0000-0002-0351-2197","KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K04982]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science",This work was partly supported by a KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid (No. JP16K04982) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).,,30,0,0,0,0,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,BRISTOL,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",0021-4922,1347-4065,,JPN J APPL PHYS,Jpn.

This study was conducted to characterize the effects of the changes in the condylar long axis and position on temporomandibular symptoms with respect proximal segment position after intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO). Study Design. Twenty Japanese patients with diagnosed jaw deformity underwent IVRO without internal fixation. Long-term changes in condylar long axis and position were assessed during postoperative follow-up examinations by using computed tomography, and t tests were performed for comparison. In addition, changes in temporomandibular symptoms were examined. Results. The degree of axial rotation of the proximal segment changed significantly when the proximal segment was located laterally. Downward changes in condylar position significantly differed when the proximal segment was located posterolaterally. Forward changes in condylar position significantly differed when the proximal segment was located laterally; moreover, when the proximal segment was located laterally, temporomandibular symptoms disappeared. Conclusions. Lateral location of the proximal segment may be an important factor in the positive effects of IVRO, with respect to temporomandibular symptoms.","[Rokutanda, Satoshi; Yanamoto, Souichi; Sakamoto, Hiroshi; Umeda, Masahiro] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Clin Oral Oncol, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan; [Rokutanda, Satoshi; Sakamoto, Hiroshi] Juko Mem Nagasaki Hosp, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg, Nagasaki, Japan; [Yamada, Shin-Ichi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Dent & Oral Surg, Nagano, Japan; [Morita, Yukiko; Rokutanda, Hiromi; Kohara, Haruka; Yoshimatsu, Masako; Yoshimi, Tomoko; Nakamura, Takuya; Ino-Kondo, Airi; Moriuchi, Emi] Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Orthodont & Dentofacial Orthoped, Nagasaki, Japan","Rokutanda, S (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ, Grad Sch Biomed Sci, Dept Clin Oral Oncol, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, Nagasaki 8528588, Japan.",jj20170075@ms.nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Yanamoto, Souichi/0000-0003-2372-8347; Morita, Yukiko/0000-0002-6117-777X",,,,16,0,0,5,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",2212-4403,1528-395X,,OR SURG OR MED OR PA,Oral Surg.

In Experiment 1 (20-week duration), nine calves (2.9-month-old females) were assigned to either a control group (CON) or an experimental group (CEL) fed cellooligosaccharide at a rate of 10 g/day mixed with concentrate. Average daily weight gain tended to be greater in CEL than in CON, especially after 1 month of weaning. In Experiment 2 (16-week duration), 10 calves (2.0-month-old females) were assigned to either a control group or an experimental group (KRA) fed kraft pulp at a rate of 10% replacement of total digestible nutrients with concentrate. The proportion of fibrolytic bacteria increased and that of methanogenic Archaea decreased in the rumen microbial community composition of KRA calves in Experiment 2, whereas the decrease in Fibrobacter and Archaea was observed in CEL calves at first 4 weeks in Experiment 1. We conclude that beta-glucan prebiotic supplementation to grazing calves at pre-weaning would affect rumen microbial composition and modified rumen fermentation characteristics, leading to a better rumen environment via different means.","[Kido, Kyoko; Tejima, Shigeki] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Div Grassland Farming, Mt Grazing Unit, Miyota, Japan; [Haramiishi, Miyuu] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Minamiminowa, Japan; [Uyeno, Yutaka; Ide, Yasuyuki] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Div Grassland Farming, Grassland Management Unit, Nasushiobara, Japan; [Kurosu, Kazuhiro] Nippon Paper Ind Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Kushibiki, Shiro] Natl Agr & Food Res Org, Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Div Anim Metab & Nutr, Ruminant Metab & Microbiol Unit, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan","Uyeno, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Minamiminowa 8304, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Kushibiki, S (reprint author), NARO Inst Livestock & Grassland Sci, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050901, Japan.",ytkuyeno@shinshu-u.ac.jp; mendoza@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,21,0,0,3,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1344-3941,1740-0929,,ANIM SCI J,Anim.

In our framework, two iterated function systems are associated with a series of conjugate equations. We state local regularity by using the invariant measures of the two iterated function systems with a common probability vector. We give several examples, especially an example such that infinitely many solutions exists, and a new class of fractal functions on the two-dimensional standard Sierpiski gasket which are not harmonic functions or fractal interpolation functions.

Pathogenic variants for CSS have been found in genes encoding proteins in the BAF (BRG1-associated factor) chromatin-remodeling complex. To date, more than 150 CSS patients with pathogenic variants in nine BAF-related genes have been reported. We previously reported 71 patients of whom 39 had pathogenic variants. Since then, we have recruited an additional 182 CSS-suspected patients. We performed comprehensive genetic analysis on these 182 patients and on the previously unresolved 32 patients, targeting pathogenic single nucleotide variants, short insertions/deletions and copy number variations (CNVs). We confirmed 78 pathogenic variations in 78 patients. Pathogenic variations in ARID1B, SMARCB1, SMARCA4, ARID1A, SOX11, SMARCE1, and PHF6 were identified in 48, 8, 7, 6, 4, 1, and 1 patients, respectively.

Methods: We prospectively assessed the incidence of median nerve symptoms (MNS) such as numbness, pain, paresthesia, or hypesthesia in the area innervated by the median nerve and evaluated post-operative nerve conduction (NC) in 91 hands of 121 patients after VLP fixation for DRF. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors independently associated with MNS and abnormal NC in the injured wrist. Results: There were 18 cases (20%) of MNS on the injured side, 9 hands (10%) of both MNS and abnormal NC, 11 hands (12%) with only abnormal NC, and 9 hands with only MNS. Sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of abnormal NC for diagnosing MNS were 50%, 86%, and 78%, respectively. Four cases did not respond to conservative treatment and received carpal tunnel release concomitantly with plate removal. Logistic regression examination revealed that volar placement of the plate and short stature were significant independent predictors of MNS, while patient age was the sole independent predictor of abnormal NC. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that plate prominence, short stature, and age were significant independent risk factors for median nerve dysfunctions after VLP fixation for DRF.","[Isobe, Fumihiro; Yamazaki, Hiroshi; Miyaoka, Shunsuke] Aizawa Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Honjo 1-5-2, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908510, Japan; [Hayashi, Masanori; Uchiyama, Shigeharu; Kato, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Yamazaki, H (reprint author), Aizawa Hosp, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Honjo 1-5-2, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908510, Japan.",hiroshiymzk1017@ybb.ne.jp,,,,,,26,0,0,7,7,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",2424-8355,2424-8363,,J HAND SURG-ASIAN-PA,J.

In this paper, we introduce an index from a supersymmetric point of view. This allows us to define indices for all chiral symmetric quantum walks such as multi-dimensional split-step quantum walks and quantum walks on graphs, for which there has been no index theory. Moreover, the index gives a lower bound on the number of bound states robust against compact perturbations. We also calculate the index for several concrete examples including the unitary transformation that appears in Grover's search algorithm.","[Suzuki, Akito] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Div Math & Phys, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Suzuki, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Div Math & Phys, Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",akito@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Suzuki, Akito/0000-0002-4140-5990","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18K03327]; Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, a Joint Usage/Research Center located in Kyoto University","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant No. JP18K03327 and by the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, a Joint Usage/Research Center located in Kyoto University.

However, excess release/contact with silver may induce harmful side-effects including carcinoma, argyria, argyrosis and allergies. Similarly, silver depletion may limit prolonged antibacterial activities as well. Thus present research proposes electrospun CA/ZnO/AgNPs composite nanofibers for biologically safer and sustained antibacterial applications. The ZnO/AgNPs were synthesized using dopamine hydrochloride (Dopa) as reducing agent to immobilize AgNPs on ZnO nanoparticles. A simple solution-mixing procedure effectively generated AgNPs on ZnO nanoparticles. Strong adhesive characteristics of Dopa initiate adsorption of silver ions on ZnO nanoparticle surfaces and its metal ion reducing properties generate AgNPs. Additionally, the Dopa mediation generates strongly adhered AgNPs. The ZnO/AgNPs were used to fabricate CA/ZnO/AgNPs nanofibers. Characterization techniques, XRD, XPS, TEM, FTIR and SEM confirmed synthesis of nanocomposites. Crystallite sizes of ZnO and AgNPs calculated by Debye-Scherrer equation were 17.85 nm and 11.68 nm respectively. Antibacterial assays confirmed CA/ZnO/AgNP's effectiveness in growth inhibition of E. coil and S. aureus strains on agar plate and in liquid medium. The nanofiber composites demonstrated 100% bactericidal properties against both the test strains. Bacterial growth inhibition in LB medium for 108 h indicated suitability of CA/ZnO/AgNPs composite nanofibers in sustained antibacterial applications such as antibacterial wound dressings and other applications demanding sustained antimicrobial properties.","[Jatoi, Abdul Wahab] Shinshu Univ, Biosci & Text Technol Dept, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Jatoi, Abdul Wahab] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Text Engn, Jamshoro 76062, Pakistan; [Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fus Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Ogasawara, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Life Sci, Ctr Res Supports Adv Sci, Div Gene Res, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Ni, Qing-Qing] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Jatoi, AW (reprint author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Dept Text Engn, Jamshoro 76062, Pakistan.",wahab.jatoi@faculty.muet.edu.pk; kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp; niqq@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Kim, Ick Soo/N-1568-2015",,,,,46,2,2,83,106,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0928-4931,1873-0191,,MAT SCI ENG C-MATER,Mater.

Cathode and anode are fiber-shaped electrodes with manganese oxide (MnO2) being electrochemically inserted into densely interconnected carbon nanotube (CNT) networks as active domains, while carbon fibers (CF) serve as current collectors. The CNT/MnO2 hybrids are built up as a co-axial shell with an optimized thickness of 1.44 mu m surrounding CF. Specific volumetric capacitance is found as high as 527 F cm(-3) when a 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution is used as electrolyte; when a solid electrolyte (polyvinyl alcohol and lithium chloride, PVA/LiCl) is used, the specific volumetric capacitance is found as high as 492 F cm(-3). These values, to the best of our knowledge, are the highest values of the specific volumetric capacitance among all the MnO2-based fiber-shaped electrodes reported in previous literature. An all-solid-state (PVA/LiCl) symmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor cell is assembled and a volumetric energy density of 8.14 mWh cm(-3 )which is high enough for driving a portable LED device, is obtained. Our fiber-shaped supercapacitor cell is safe, flexible, and capable of powering smart electronic devices. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An apparatus was designed to simulate the interlacing condition of one set of yarns, and the water transport distance versus time can be obtained. With the apparatus, the effect of twist on the water transport of interlaced cotton yarns was explored. The results showed that for higher twisted yarns, the water transport distance was shorter than that for lower twisted ones. For higher twisted yarns, in spite of the same outward appearance, the actual water transport route was longer. Moreover, with the apparatus, the interlacing angle can be changed from 0(o) to 180(o) at 20(o) intervals, and the effect of the interlacing angle was explored, which can be applied to simulate yarn crimp in woven fabric. The water transport at interlacing angles of 40(o), 80(o), 120(o), and 160(o) was discussed, and we found that the interlacing angle decreased the water transport distance in weft yarns because of the decreased contact distance. It can be concluded that the twist and interlacing angle had an important effect on water transport in interlaced yarns. This study is a basic study for research on the mechanism of water transport, and it shows understanding of the relationship between the fabric structure and its physical property. It can be applied not only for woven fabrics, but also for knitted fabrics, braids, and some other fiber assemblies.","[Zhu, Chunhong; Tada, Haruka; Yan, Jiawei; Morikawa, Hideaki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Shi, Jian] Akita Prefectural Univ, Fac Syst Sci & Technol, 84-4 Aza Ebinokuchi Tsuchiya, Akita 0150055, Japan","Zhu, CH (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Shi, J (reprint author), Akita Prefectural Univ, Fac Syst Sci & Technol, 84-4 Aza Ebinokuchi Tsuchiya, Akita 0150055, Japan.",zhu@shinshu-u.ac.jp; shij@akita-pu.ac.jp,,,,,,32,1,1,12,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0040-5175,1746-7748,,TEXT RES J,Text.

Herein, we reported updated and expanded results for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing chemicals from GlcNAc in high-temperature water at 180-280 degrees C and 25 MPa with a reaction time of 5-34 s. The main products were 2-acetamido-2,3-dideoxy-D-erythro-hex-2-enofuranose (Chromogen I) and 3-acetamido-5-(1',2'-dihydroxyethyl)furan (Chromogen III) with the maximum yields of 37.0% and 34.5%, respectively. Although 3-acetamido-5-acetylfuran was expected to form by the dehydration of Chromogen III, a yield of only < 1% was obtained, likely because the dehydration of Chromogen III is difficult in the absence of a catalyst. The evaluation of the effects of acid and base catalysts on the dehydration of GlcNAc revealed that the acid catalyst suppressed the transformation of GlcNAc to Chromogen I and promoted the transformation of Chromogen I to Chromogen III, whereas the base catalyst had the opposite effects on these processes. The synthesis of nitrogen-containing chemicals from GlcNAc in high temperature water is an environmentally benign method for utilizing renewable chitin biomass.","[Osada, Mitsumasa; Shoji, Shinya; Suenaga, Shin] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Mat, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Ogata, Makoto] Natl Inst Technol, Fukushima Coll, Dept Appl Chem & Biochem, Nagao 30, Iwaki, Fukushima 9708034, Japan","Osada, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, Dept Chem & Mat, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",osadam@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Osada, Mitsumasa/I-8117-2014","Osada, Mitsumasa/0000-0003-3232-5857","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [17H048931]","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number 17H048931.

Here, we report on an English version of the 2019 Japanese Melanoma Guidelines. In this latest edition, all processes were carried out according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. A comprehensive published work search, systematic review and determination of recommendations in each clinical question were performed by a multidisciplinary expert panel consisting of dermatologists, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and a radiation oncologist. The advent of novel agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular-targeted agents, has drastically changed the nature of treatment for adjuvant and advanced-stage diseases among melanoma patients worldwide. Additionally, recent reports of clinical trials regarding surgical procedures and a better understanding of molecular biology and tumor immunology in clinical types of melanoma have had an impact on clinical practise. Based on these viewpoints, eight relevant clinical questions were raised in this report that aim to help clinicians select the appropriate therapeutic approach.","[Nakamura, Yasuhiro; Teramoto, Yukiko] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Skin Oncol Dermatol, Int Med Ctr, 1397-1 Yamane, Saitama 3501298, Japan; [Asai, Jun; Wada, Makoto] Kyoto Prefectural Univ Med, Dept Dermatol, Kyoto, Japan; [Igaki, Hiroshi] Natl Canc Ctr, Dept Radiat Oncol, Tokyo, Japan; [Inozume, Takashi] Univ Yamanashi, Dept Dermatol, Kofu, Yamanashi, Japan; [Namikawa, Kcnjiro] Natl Canc Ctr, Dept Dermatol Oncol, Tokyo, Japan; [Hayashi, Ayato] Juntendo Univ, Dept Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Urayasu Hosp, Urayasu, Japan; [Fukushima, Satoshi; Miyashita, Azusa] Kumamoto Univ, Dept Dermatol Plast & Reconstruct Surg, Kumamoto, Japan; [Fujimura, Taku] Tohoku Univ, Dept Dermatol, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan; [Ito, Takamichi] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Dermatol, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Imafuku, Keisuke] Hokkaido Univ, Dept Dermatol, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan; [Tanaka, Ryota] Univ Tsukuba, Fac Med, Dept Dermatol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Minagawa, Akane; Koga, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Dermatol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Miyagawa, Takuya] Univ Tokyo, Dept Dermatol, Tokyo, Japan; [Sugaya, Makoto] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Dept Dermatol, Narita, Japan","Nakamura, Y (reprint author), Saitama Med Univ, Dept Skin Oncol Dermatol, Int Med Ctr, 1397-1 Yamane, Saitama 3501298, Japan.",ynakamur@saitama-med.co.jp,"Asai, Jun/AAD-4796-2020","Asai, Jun/0000-0002-7610-0820; Fukushima, Satoshi/0000-0002-0622-7682; Takamichi, Ito/0000-0002-2679-8546",Japanese Dermatological AssociationNew Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO),,,63,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0385-2407,1346-8138,,J DERMATOL,J.

In this work, we report experimentally the skyrmion generation through the usage of a nonmagnetic conducting Ti/Au point contact in a device made of a Ta/CoFeB/TaOx trilayer film. Moreover, the accompanied topological charge-dependent skyrmion dynamics, namely the skyrmion Hall effect, is also observed in the same device. The creation process of a skyrmion has been numerically reproduced through micromagnetic simulations, in which the important role of the skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair formation is identified. The motion and Hall effect of a skyrmion, immediately after its creation, is described using a modified Thiele equation after taking into account the contribution from spatially inhomogeneous spin-orbit torques and the Magnus force. Our results on the simultaneous generation and manipulation of skyrmions using a nonmagnetic point contact are useful for understanding the ultrafast dynamics of skyrmion creation, which could also provide an effective pathway for designing skyrmion-based devices.","[Wang, Zidong; Zhao, Le; Wu, Keyu; Jiang, Wanjun] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Low Dimens Quantum Phys, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zidong; Zhao, Le; Wu, Keyu; Jiang, Wanjun] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Phys, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zidong; Zhao, Le; Wu, Keyu; Jiang, Wanjun] Tsinghua Univ, Frontier Sci Ctr Quantum Informat, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xichao; Xia, Jing; Zhou, Yan] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Sch Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518172, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Guoqiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Natl Lab Condensed Matter Phys, Inst Phys, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kang L.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Liu, Xiaoxi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [te Velthuis, Suzanne G.

DMD involves cardiac muscle, and the presence of ventricular arrhythmias or congestive failure is critical for prognosis. Several novel therapeutic approaches are being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Among them, exon-skipping therapy to correct frameshift mutations with antisense oligonucleotides is promising; however, their therapeutic efficacies on cardiac muscle in vivo remain unknown. In this study, we established induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from T cells from a DMD patient carrying a DMD-exon 46-55 deletion, differentiated the iPSCs into cardiomyocytes, and treated them with phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. The efficiency of exon-45 skipping increased in a dose-dependent manner and enabled restoration of the DMD gene product, dystrophin. Further, Ca2+-imaging analysis showed a decreased number of arrhythmic cells and improved transient Ca(2+)signaling after exon skipping. Thus, exon-45 skipping may be effective for cardiac involvement in DMD patients harboring the DMD-exon 46-55 deletion. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Material and Methods We performed a multi-institutional, retrospective study named NEJ023 for patients with advanced thymic carcinoma. Patients without indications for curative treatment were treated with chemotherapy from 1995 to 2014 at 40 institutions in the North East Japan Study Group. Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, data on treatment methods, and outcomes of second-line chemotherapy were obtained from medical records. Results In total, 191 patients were enrolled in this study. Second-line chemotherapy included platinum-based doublets in 57.6% of patients, other multidrug chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide) in 13.6%, and monotherapy in 28.8%. The median follow-up time was 50.5 months, and the median overall survival (OS) from the start of second-line chemotherapy was 22.4 (95% confidence interval, 17.5-26.7) months. The average response rate (RR) was 20.0% overall; it was 21.6% for patients treated with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, 13.6% for those treated with other multidrug chemotherapy, and 19.6% for those treated with single agent chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in OS between platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, other multidrug chemotherapy, and monotherapy (the median OS was 22.4, 25.7, and 21.4 months, respectively). Conclusion The median OS was 22.4 months in patients with advanced thymic carcinoma treated with second-line chemotherapy. There were no significant differences in RR and OS between monotherapy and multidrug chemotherapy in this study. Implications for Practice Owing to the rarity of this tumor, there is limited information about second-line chemotherapy for patients with previously treated advanced thymic carcinoma. This is the largest data for those patients treated with second-line chemotherapy. This study suggests there is no significant difference in efficacy between monotherapy and multidrug chemotherapy for previously treated advanced thymic carcinoma. This result can support the adequacy to select monotherapy as treatment of those patients.","[Tateishi, Kazunari] Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Koizumi, Tomonobu] Shinshu Univ, Dept Comprehens Canc Therapy, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Ko, Ryo; Shukuya, Takehito; Takahashi, Kazuhisa] Juntendo Univ, Dept Resp Med, Grad Sch Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Okuma, Yusuke] Komagome Hosp, Dept Thorac Oncol & Resp Med, Tokyo Metropolitan Canc & Infect Dis Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Satoshi] Niigata Univ, Dept Resp Med & Infect Dis, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Niigata, Japan; [Kuyama, Shoichi] Natl Hosp Org Iwakuni Clin Ctr, Dept Resp Med, Iwakuni, Japan; [Murase, Kyoko] Toranomon Gen Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Tsukita, Yoko] Miyagi Canc Ctr, Dept Resp Med, Natori, Miyagi, Japan; [Ashinuma, Hironori] Chiba Canc Ctr, Div Resp Med, Chiba, Japan; [Nakagawa, Taku] Omagari Kosei Med Ctr, Dept Thorac Surg, Daisen, Japan; [Uematsu, Kazutsugu] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Pulm Med, Saitama Med Ctr, Kawagoe, Saitama, Japan; [Nakao, Mika] Shimane Univ, Div Med Oncol Resp Med, Dept Internal Med, Fac Med, Izumo, Shimane, Japan; [Mori, Yoshiaki] Iwate Cent Prefectural Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Morioka, Iwate, Japan; [Kaira, Kyoichi] Gunma Univ, Dept Innovat Immune Oncol Therapeut, Grad Sch Med, Maebashi, Gumma, Japan; [Kaira, Kyoichi; Mouri, Atsuto; Kobayashi, Kunihiko] Saitama Med Univ, Dept Resp Med, Int Med Ctr, Saitama, Japan; [Mouri, Atsuto] Natl Hosp Org Disaster Med Ctr, Dept Pulm Med, Tachikawa, Tokyo, Japan; [Miyabayashi, Takao] Niigata City Gen Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Niigata, Japan; [Sakashita, Hiroyuki] Tokyo Med & Dent Univ, Dept Resp Med, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsumoto, Yoko] NTT Med Ctr Tokyo, Div Respirol, Tokyo, Japan; [Tanigawa, Tomoyuki] St Lukes Int Hosp, Div Pulm Med, Thorac Ctr, Tokyo, Japan; [Morita, Satoshi] Kyoto Univ, Dept Biomed Stat & Bioinformat, Grad Sch Med, Kyoto, Japan; [Nukiwa, Toshihiro] Tohoku Univ, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan","Ko, R; Shukuya, T (reprint author), Juntendo Univ, Dept Resp Med, Grad Sch Med, Bunkyo Ku, 2-1-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138421, Japan.",rkou@juntendo.ac.jp; tshukuya@juntendo.ac.jp,,"Tanigawa, Tomoyuki/0000-0001-6799-3519","Department of Respiratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine","This study was funded by the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine.

However, there are few evidence-based interventions. We developed Autism-Focused Public Speech Training using Simple Virtual Audiences (APSV), which differs from a general virtual audience in terms of its simple facial expressions and emphasis on the importance of the eyes. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of APSV as an educational method for individuals with ASD. Methods Fifteen male individuals with ASD were randomly assigned to two groups: one group received APSV (n = 8), and the other group (n = 7) received independent study (IS). From Days 2 to 6, participants in the APSV and IS groups were encouraged to read and answer questions often asked in actual public speaking events. Participants in the APSV study group performed this activity in front of the APSV system, while those in the IS group performed in an empty room. Before and after the intervention (Days 1 and 7), the participants in the two groups had a mock public speaking experience in front of 10 people for approximately 10 min. Results After the training sessions, the participants' self-confidence had improved and salivary cortisol levels were significantly decreased in the APSV group as compared to those in the IS group. APSV improved self-confidence and decreased public speaking stress in individuals with ASD.

This advantage of the method makes it possible to distinguish the Pb between natural origin and anthropogenic source on the basis of the isotope ratios.

Although this therapy is well known in Japan, its efficacy and safety remain unclear. Methods This investigator-initiated and -driven, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (UMIN000020868) enrolled 39 patients with predicted SAP and low enhancement of the pancreatic parenchyma on computed tomography (CT). Twenty patients were assigned to the CRAI group, while 19 served as controls and were administered NM at the same dose intravenously (IV group). The primary endpoint was the development of pancreatic necrosis as determined by CT on Day 14, judged by blinded central review. Results There was no difference between the CRAI and IV groups regarding the percentages of participants who developed pancreatic necrosis (more than 1/3 of the pancreas: 25.0%, range 8.7-49.1% vs. 15.8%, range 3.4-39.6%, respectively, P = 0.694; more than 2/3 of the pancreas: 20%, range 5.7-43.7% vs. 5.3%, range 0.1-26.0%, respectively, P = 0.341). The early analgesic effect was evaluated based on 24-h cumulative fentanyl consumption and additional administration by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia. The results showed that the CRAI group used significantly less analgesic. There were two adverse events related to CRAI, namely bleeding and splenic infarction. Conclusions CRAI with NM did not inhibit the development of pancreatic necrosis although early analgesic effect of CRAI was superior to that of IV. Less-invasive IV therapy can be considered a viable alternative to CRAI therapy.","[Hirota, Morihisa] Tohoku Med & Pharmaceut Univ, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Miyagino Ku, 1-15-1 Fukumuro, Sendai, Miyagi 9838536, Japan; [Shimosegawa, Tooru] South Miyagi Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 28-1 Nishi, Ohgawara, Miyagi 9891253, Japan; [Kitamura, Katsuya] Showa Univ, Sch Med, Dept Med, Div Gastroenterol,Shinagawa Ku, 1-5-8 Hatanodai, Tokyo 1428666, Japan; [Kitamura, Katsuya] Tokyo Med Univ, Hachioji Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, 1163 Tatemachi, Hachioji, Tokyo 1930998, Japan; [Takeda, Kazunori] Hlth Insurance Claims Review & Reimbursement Serv, Miyagi Branch, Miyagino Ku, 5-1-27 Tsutsujigaoka, Sendai, Miyagi 9838504, Japan; [Takeyama, Yoshifumi] Kindai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Surg, 377-2 Ohno Higashi, Osaka, Osaka, Japan; [Mayumi, Toshihiko] Univ Occupat & Environm Hlth, Dept Emergency Med, Yahatanishi Ku, 1-1 Iseigaoka, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8078555, Japan; [Ito, Tetsuhide] Int Univ Hlth & Welf, Neuroendocrine Tumor Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Fukuoka Sanno Hosp,Grad Sch Med,Sawara Ku, 3-6-45 Momochihama, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8140001, Japan; [Takenaka, Mamoru] Kindai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Gastroenterol & Hepatol, 377-2 Ohno Higashi, Osaka, Osaka 5898511, Japan; [Iwasaki, Eisuke] Keio Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol,Shinjuku Ku, 35 Shinanomachi, Tokyo 1608582, Japan; [Sawano, Hirotaka] Osaka Saiseikai Senri Hosp, Senri Crit Care Med Ctr, 1-1-6 Tsukumodai, Suita, Osaka 5650862, Japan; [Ishida, Etsuji] Kurashiki Cent Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, 1-1-1 Miwa, Kurashiki, Okayama 7108602, Japan; [Miura, Shin; Masamune, Atsushi] Tohoku Univ, Grad Sch Med, Div Gastroenterol, Aoba Ku, 1-1 Seiryo, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan; [Nakai, Yousuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Tokyo, Japan; [Nakai, Yousuke] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Med, Dept Endoscopy & Endoscop Surg, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138655, Japan; [Mitoro, Akira] Nara Med Univ, Dept Internal Med 3, 840 Shijo Cho, Kashihara, Nara 6348522, Japan; [Maguchi, Hiroyuki] Teine Keijinkai Hosp, Ctr Gastroenterol, Teine Ku, 1-12-1-40 Maeda, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0068555, Japan; [Kimura, Kenji] Sendai Med Ctr, Natl Hosp Org, Dept Gastroenterol, Miyagino Ku, 2-11-12 Miyagino, Sendai, Miyagi 9838520, Japan; [Sanuki, Tsuyoshi] Kita Harima Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 926-250 Ichiba Cho, Ono, Hokkaido 6751392, Japan; [Ito, Tetsuya] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Internal Med Gastroenterol, 3-1-1 Akashi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Ito, Tetsuya] Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Div Gastroenterol, 5-22-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808582, Japan; [Haradome, Hiroki] Kitasato Univ, Sch Med, Dept Radiol Adv Med, Minami Ku, 1-15-1 Kitasato, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 2520375, Japan; [Kozaka, Kazuto; Gabata, Toshifumi] Kanazawa Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Radiol, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9208641, Japan; [Kataoka, Keisho] Otsu Municipal Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, 2-9-9 Motomiya, Otsu, Shiga 5200804, Japan; [Hirota, Masahiko] Kumamoto Reg Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Chuou Ku, 5-16-10 Honjou, Kumamoto 8600811, Japan; [Isaji, Shuji] Mie Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Hepatobiliary Pancreat & Transplant Surg, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan; [Nakamura, Ryoji] Inter Sci Res Co Ltd, Nakano Ku, 3-14-1 Higashinakano, Tokyo 1640003, Japan; [Yamagiwa, Koki; Kayaba, Chie; Ikeda, Koji] Tohoku Univ Hosp, Clin Res Innovat Educ Ctr, Dept Dev Promot, Aoba Ku, 1-1 Seiryo, Sendai, Miyagi 9808574, Japan","Hirota, M (reprint author), Tohoku Med & Pharmaceut Univ, Div Gastroenterol & Hepatol, Miyagino Ku, 1-15-1 Fukumuro, Sendai, Miyagi 9838536, Japan.",morihirota7373@gmail.com,"Kitamura, Katsuya/I-9527-2019; Nakai, Yousuke/H-2964-2019","Kitamura, Katsuya/0000-0003-1556-7467; Nakai, Yousuke/0000-0001-7411-1385","Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) [JP15lk0103015, JP16lk0103015]",This work was completed with the significant assistance of the medical and nursing staff of the participating hospitals in enrolling and caring for patients.

Various adsorption sites including the on-top, bridge, and hollow sites in the ridge, (100) facet, and (111) facet were considered. The molecular adsorption energy on the slab model is affected by the adsorption configurations. By contrast, we observed different NO adsorption energies even for the same configuration on the same NP's surface facet, that is, the adsorptions of NO on the bridge sites in the (111) facets were different depending on the relative location from the ridge. The band center estimated from the partial density of states was correlated with the NO adsorption energy for the on-top site. However, when all adsorption sites were considered, the band center did not correlate well with the NO adsorption energy. We performed supervised learning for the calculated NO adsorption energies on M-405-NPs. Descriptors related to the second nearest-neighboring atoms to N and nearest-neighboring atoms to the adsorption site predicted the NO adsorption energy of all sites on M-405-NPs together with the d-band center of atoms in the adsorption site and its standard deviation.","[Nanba, Yusuke; Koyama, Michihisa] Natl Inst Mat Sci, Ctr Green Res Energy & Environm Mat, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan; [Koyama, Michihisa] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Nanba, Y; Koyama, M (reprint author), Natl Inst Mat Sci, Ctr Green Res Energy & Environm Mat, 1-1 Namiki, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050044, Japan.; Koyama, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",NANBA.Yusuke@nims.go.jp; KOYAMA.michihisa@nims.go.jp,,"Nanba, Yusuke/0000-0002-1692-4465","ACCEL, JST [JPMJAC 1501]","This work was supported by ACCEL, JST (JPMJAC 1501), and the computation was performed using the facilities of Research Institute for Information Technology, Kyushu University.",,69,0,0,7,7,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",1932-7447,1932-7455,,J PHYS CHEM C,J.

Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an essential procedure for patients with acute kidney injury in intensive care. It is important to maintain an adequate blood flow rate during CRRT. Several previous studies have reported the relationships between blood flow rate and filter lifespan, or circuit life, in CRRT. Here, we aim at elucidating the incidence and factors associated with a decreased blood flow rate in CRRT. Methods. This is a retrospective observational study. From January 2014 to June 2017, 119 patients who underwent CRRT in the intensive care unit were enrolled. The definition of a decreased blood flow rate included situations in which the medical staff needed to decrease the blood flow volume. We statistically analyzed the association of the decreased blood flow rate with patients' clinical characteristics. Results. Of 119 patients, 52 required a decreased blood flow rate during CRRT. Almost half of the cases occurred within one day of starting CRRT. None of the clinical factors (age, sex, height, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score, catheter position, systemic infection, albumin, hemoglobin, and activating coagulation time) were significantly associated with decreased blood flow rate. Conclusions. A decreased blood flow rate often occurs during CRRT. Clinical factors significantly associated with the occurrence of the decreased blood flow rate were not detected in the current study. Further investigation regarding the occurrence of a decreased blood flow is warranted.","[Harada, Makoto; Ooki, Masafumi; Kohashi, Kaede; Ichikawa, Tohru; Kobayashi, Mamoru] Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 5-22-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808582, Japan; [Harada, Makoto] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nephrol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Harada, M (reprint author), Nagano Red Cross Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 5-22-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808582, Japan.; Harada, M (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nephrol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tokomadaraha724@gmail.com,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2090-1305,2090-1313,,CRIT CARE RES PRACT,Crit.

The current-driven helicity reversal of the skyrmionic bubble in a nanostructured frustrated Fe3Sn2 magnet is experimentally demonstrated. The critical current density required to trigger the helicity reversal is 10(9)-10(10) A m(-2), with a corresponding pulse-width varying from 1 mu s to 100 ns.

Although some studies have observed the efficacy of music therapy for improving pain and anxiety, its effectiveness during haemodialysis access cannulations during dialysis is uncertain. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music therapy for pain when cannulating haemodialysis access for haemodialysis patients. Methods: A prospective, multi-facility, single-blind, crossover, randomised controlled trial will be implemented. The intervention includes listening to Mozart, along with a white noise control condition. One hundred twenty haemodialysis patients will be enrolled across five facilities. Patients will be randomly allocated to either an Early-sequence group or a Later-sequence group. The Early-sequence group will receive cannulation while listening to Mozart's Sonata for two pianos in D major (K.448) during the second week (Music period) and white noise during the fourth week (White noise period). The Later-sequence group will receive cannulation along with white noise first, followed by Mozart. All patients will also undergo cannulation during a no-sound period (wearing only headphones) during the first and third week (No-sound period). The music or no-music protocol will begin 8 min prior to the cannulating procedure, and participants will finish listening after starting haemodialysis during each period. The primary outcomes that will be assessed include the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain during cannulation, and secondary outcomes are blood pressure, heart rate, VAS anxiety score, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory score, and salivary amylase activity. The operators who are in charge of haemodialysis access cannulation will be blind to the listening condition and VAS report. Discussion: The proposed study has several methodological benefits. First, using white noise is a suitable control condition for addressing the role of sound in pain management. Additionally, using a crossover design with repeated measurements can help control individual differences between participants, which should better distinguish between- and within-participant variability. Overall, music therapy is a safe and inexpensive intervention that does not have the problematic side effects typically associated with pharmacological treatment. If effective, music therapy can be easily implemented for reducing pain and anxiety during cannulation.","[Kishida, Masatsugu] Natl Cerebral & Cardiovasc Ctr, Div Nephrol, 6-1 Kishibeshinmachi, Suita, Osaka 5648565, Japan; [Yamada, Yosuke] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Nephrol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Inayama, Emi] Mihama Narita Clin, 129-1 Iida Cho, Narita 2860041, Japan; [Kitamura, Mineaki; Nishino, Tomoya] Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 8528501, Japan; [Ota, Keiko; Shintani, Ayumi] Osaka City Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Med Stat, 1-4-3 Asahi Cho, Osaka 5450051, Japan; [Ikenoue, Tatsuyoshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med & Publ Hlth, Sakyo Ku, 53 Kawahara Cho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan","Kitamura, M (reprint author), Nagasaki Univ Hosp, Dept Nephrol, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki 8528501, Japan.",minekitamura@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,"Kitamura, Mineaki/0000-0002-0003-8645",Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences (S-fund); AIBA WORKS Young Doctor Support Project (A-fund); TERUMO Foundation for Life Sciences and Arts (T-fund),"This proposal is supported by the Shinshu Public Utility Foundation for the Promotion of Medical Sciences (S-fund), an AIBA WORKS Young Doctor Support Project (A-fund) and the TERUMO Foundation for Life Sciences and Arts (T-fund).

Objectives: To propose an evidence- and trend-based treatment algorithm for SSNHL. Methods: We referred not only to the evidence for each treatment, but also to trends related to treatment selection in Japan based on epidemiologic surveys, and considered the balance of the advantages and disadvantages with regard to each patient's condition. Results: We propose an algorithm that begins with the grade of SSNHL severity as the prognosis of SSNHL is strongly related to the severity of hearing loss. We selected systemic corticosteroid therapy as the first-line therapy, and Intra-tympanic corticosteroid therapy as salvage therapy. We also proposed the use of prostaglandin E1 with corticosteroids for the treatment of SSNHL patients with severe hearing loss. According to the data obtained from an epidemiologic survey, we decided time limits for the application of each treatment. Conclusion: An algorithm for the treatment for SSNHL is presented according to the results of epidemiologic surveys in Japan. It is expected that this algorithm can provide a guide to choosing the suitable treatment for SSNHL patients.","[Kitoh, Ryosuke; Nishio, Shin-Ya; Usami, Shin-Ichi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Usami, SI (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",usami@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Health and Labour Sciences Research Grant for Comprehensive Research on Disability Health and Welfare from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of JapanMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan [H29-Nanchito (Nan)-Ippan-031]","This study was supported by a Health and Labour Sciences Research Grant for Comprehensive Research on Disability Health and Welfare from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (http://www.mhlw.go.jp/english/) (H29-Nanchito (Nan)-Ippan-031, S.U.).",,20,0,0,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0001-6489,1651-2251,,ACTA OTO-LARYNGOL,Acta Oto-Laryngol.,2-Jan,2020,140,1,,,,,32,39,,10.1080/00016489.2019.1687936,,19-Nov,8,Otorhinolaryngology,Otorhinolaryngology,KB5XZ,WOS:000497011500001,31738639,"Bronze, Other Gold",,,2020/4/20

We aimed to address the gap in knowledge of gambling disorders and treatment for this population. Methods Data were obtained from 1471 Japanese undergraduate students from 19 universities in Japan. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical multivariate regression analysis were used to investigate whether the factors of gambling cognitive distortions would have predictive effects on gambling disorder symptoms. Results Results indicated that 5.1% of the participants are classifiable as probable disordered gamblers. The bias of the gambling type to pachinko and pachislot was unique to gamblers in Japan. Of the students sampled, 342 self-reported gambling symptoms via the South Oaks Gambling Screen. Hierarchical multivariate regression analysis indicated that one domain of gambling cognitive distortions was associated significantly with gambling symptoms among the 342 symptomatic participants: gambling expectancy (beta = 0.19, p < .05). The multivariate model explained 47% of the variance in the gambling symptoms. Conclusion This study successfully contributed to the sparse research on university student gambling in Japan. Specifically, our results indicated a statistically significant relationship between gambling cognitive distortions and gambling disorder symptoms. These results can inform the development of preventive education and treatment for university students with gambling disorder in Japan. The report also describes needs for future research of university students with gambling disorder.","[Yokomitsu, Kengo] Ritsumeikan Univ, 2-150 Iwakura Cho, Ibaraki, Osaka 5678570, Japan; [Sakai, Takanobu] Konan Womens Univ, Higashinada Ku, 6-2-23 Morikita Machi, Kobe, Hyogo 6580001, Japan; [Irie, Tomonari] Hokusho Univ, 23 Bunkyodai, Ebetsu, Hokkaido 0698511, Japan; [Tayama, Jun] Waseda Univ, 2-579-15 Mikajima, Tokorozawa, Saitama 3591164, Japan; [Furukawa, Hirokazu] Naruto Univ Educ, 748 Nakashima,Naruto Cho, Naruto, Tokushima 7728502, Japan; [Himachi, Mika; Takada, Takuhiro] Tokai Gakuen Univ, Tenpaku Ku, 2-901 Nakahira, Nagoya, Aichi 4688514, Japan; [Kanazawa, Junichiro; Matsuoka, Hirofumi] Hlth Sci Univ Hokkaido, 1757 Kanazawa, Tobetsu, Hokkaido 0610293, Japan; [Koda, Munenaga] Tokushima Univ, 1-1 Minamijosanjimacho, Tokushima 7708502, Japan; [Kunisato, Yoshihiko] Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashimita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan; [Takahashi, Fumito] Shinshu Univ, Nishi Nagano 6 Ro, Nagano 3808544, Japan; [Takahashi, Takahito] Univ Miyazaki, 1-1 Gakuenkibanadai Nishi, Miyazaki 8892192, Japan; [Osawa, Kaori] Konan Univ, Higashinada Ku, 8-9-1 Okamoto, Kobe, Hyogo 6588501, Japan","Yokomitsu, K (reprint author), Ritsumeikan Univ, 2-150 Iwakura Cho, Ibaraki, Osaka 5678570, Japan.",k-yoko@fc.ritsumei.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [19 K14431]",This research was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 19 K14431.,,30,1,1,3,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1747-597X,,SUBST ABUSE TREAT PR,Subst/ Abus.

Precise understanding of myoblast properties is thus indispensable for meat production. Herein, we report the cellular characteristics and gene expression profiles of primary-cultured myoblasts of layer and broiler chickens. Broiler myoblasts actively proliferated and promptly differentiated into myotubes compared to layer myoblasts, which corresponds well with the muscle phenotype of broilers. Transcriptomes of layer and broiler myoblasts during differentiation were quantified by RNA sequencing. Ontology analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) provided a series of extracellular proteins as putative markers for characterization of chicken myogenic cells. Another ontology analyses demonstrated that broiler myogenic cells are rich in cell cycle factors and muscle components. Independent of these semantic studies, principal component analysis (PCA) statistically defined two gene sets: one governing myogenic differentiation and the other segregating layers and broilers. Thirteen candidate genes were identified with a combined study of the DEGs and PCA that potentially contribute to proliferation or differentiation of chicken myoblasts. We experimentally proved that one of the candidates, enkephalin, an opioid peptide, suppresses myoblast growth. Our results present a new perspective that the opioids present in feeds may influence muscle development of domestic animals.","[Nihashi, Yuma; Shinji, Sayaka; Ono, Tamao; Takaya, Tomohide] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Agr, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Umezawa, Koji; Ono, Tamao; Kagami, Hiroshi; Takaya, Tomohide] Shinshu Univ, Dept Agr & Life Sci, Fac Agr, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Umezawa, Koji; Takaya, Tomohide] Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Interdisciplinary Genome Sci & Cell Metab, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Hamaguchi, Yu; Kobayashi, Hisato] Tokyo Univ Agr, NODAI Genome Res Ctr, Setagaya Ku, 1-1-1 Sakuragaoka, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Kono, Tomohiro] Tokyo Univ Agr, Dept Biosci, Setagaya Ku, 1-1-1 Sakuragaoka, Tokyo 1568502, Japan; [Kobayashi, Hisato] Nara Med Univ, Dept Embryol, 840 Shijo Cho, Kashihara, Nara 6348521, Japan","Takaya, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Agr, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Takaya, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Agr & Life Sci, Fac Agr, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Takaya, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Interdisciplinary Genome Sci & Cell Metab, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",ttakaya@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Takaya, Tomohide/D-6372-2012","Takaya, Tomohide/0000-0002-3610-0906; Nihashi, Yuma/0000-0002-5689-116X; Kobayashi, Hisato/0000-0003-3800-4691","Ito Foundation; Shinshu Foundation for Promotion of Agricultural and Forest Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19J20888, 16K07986, JP26450376]; Fund of Nagano Prefecture [H293-12]; Genome Research for BioResource, NODAI Genome Research Center, Tokyo University of Agriculture","We thank Ms. Chikako Miyazaki for her excellent technical assistance.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of and risk factors for postoperative hemorrhage after lower third molar extraction in Japanese patients receiving warfarin therapy. A total of 142 patients who underwent lower third molar extraction between January 2010 and December 2016 were included, and their medical records were retrospectively reviewed. The prevalence of and risk factors for postoperative hemorrhage were investigated. The prevalence of postoperative hemorrhage after lower third molar extraction was significantly higher in patients receiving warfarin than in healthy subjects (21.8% vs 0.7%, P < 0.001). The cutoff value for PT-INR was 2.11 based on a receiver-operating characteristic analysis. A multivariate analysis indicated that an elevated PT-INR value [hazard ratio (HR) 3.798, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.400-10.467, P < 0.01], preoperative antibiotic administration (HR 4.434, 95% CI 1.591-14.775, P < 0.01), difficulties with intraoperative hemostasis (HR 16.298, 95% CI 2.986-110.677, P < 0.01), and higher serum creatinine levels (HR 7.465, 95% CI 1.616-39.576, P < 0.05) are significant predictors of postoperative hemorrhage after lower third molar extraction. Multivariate correlations were observed between risk factors including an elevated PT-INR value, preoperative antibiotic administration, and higher serum creatinine levels, and postoperative hemorrhage after lower third molar extraction in patients receiving warfarin therapy.

The dependence of the spinnability and tensile strength of the fibers on the zero-shear viscosity of the spinning solutions was investigated based on differences in the molecular weight of the cellulose, pulp concentration, and the pH of BMIMCl. We demonstrated an appropriate viscosity range of 2000-4000 Pa s(-1) (100 degrees C) for spinning dopes to obtain good spinnability and high tensile strength. The pH of the BMIMCl and the molecular weight of the cellulose clearly impacted tensile strength. The high molecular weight of cellulose contributed to high mechanical properties of the regenerated cellulose fibers. Optimizing the molecular weight and concentration of the cellulose based on the appropriate viscosity allowed us to prepare high performance cellulose fibers with a tensile strength of 1.15 GPa and a Young's modulus of 42.9 GPa.

This three-phase Co@PANI@PU composite is fabricated through mechanical ball milling of Co microspheres and PANI particles, followed by their casting forming with PU. Prior to that, Co microspheres and conductive PANI are synthesized by ultrasonic-assisted solution reduction and simple oxidation polymerization, respectively. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction characterizations indicate that the Co microparticles have sufficient incorporation into PANI and PU matrices. Electrical conductivity measurement shows that the PANI composition improved the conductivity of Co@PANI@PU film, whereas the Co composition suppressed it. The microwave absorption property of these Co@PANI@PU composite films under low filling contents of Co and PANI, and with small thickness (1 mm), is investigated in the 0.1-18 GHz range. The results indicate that the reflection loss increased with increasing Co and PANI compositions. 16:8:100 w/w/w Co@PANI@PU shows the highest absorption within 0.1-8.8 GHz, whereas 16:16:100 Co@PANI@PU absorbed most at 10.2-18 GHz. This is attributed to different contributions of permittivity and permeability of the Co and PANI compositions to energy loss in the two frequency bands. Therefore, appropriate ratio and content of the Co and PANI compositions play significant roles for frequency-adjustable microwave absorption.","[Yan, Yongjie] Shinshu Univ, Res Initiat Supra Mat, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Xia, Hong; Ni, Qing-Qing] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan; [Qiu, Yiping] Donghua Univ, Coll Text, Dept High Tech Text, Shanghai 201620, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhenzhen] Anhui Polytech Univ, Coll Text & Garments, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China","Ni, QQ (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan.; Xu, ZZ (reprint author), Anhui Polytech Univ, Coll Text & Garments, Wuhu 241000, Anhui, Peoples R China.",xuzhenzhen@ahpu.edu.cn; niqq@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS (MEXT) KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15H01789, 26420721]; Nanotechnology Platform Program, Shinshu University","This work was supported by JSPS (MEXT financial supports) KAKENHI no. 15H01789 and 26420721.

The B incorporation is achieved at a growth temperature of 618 degrees C, which is slightly higher than the optimal growth temperature of g-C3N4 thin films. The signal peak for the B 1s core level attributed to B-N bonds is observed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, indicating the realization of B incorporation into g-C3N4 films. With an increase in the growth temperature up to 650 degrees C, a monotonically increasing B composition and a decreasing C composition are observed, implying that B atoms are incorporated into g-C3N4 by the substitution into C sites. A shift of photoluminescene (PL) peak energy is observed. The PL peak shifts from 2.75 eV for unintentionally doped thin film to 3.60 eV for B-incorporated thin films with a composition of 8.0%. The B composition dependence of PL peak energies is in good agreement with the quadratic function, suggesting that the bandgap bowing occurs due to B incorporation into the g-C3N4 thin films as in conventional compound semiconductor alloys.","[Urakami, Noriyuki; Kosaka, Maito; Hashimoto, Yoshio] Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Urakami, Noriyuki; Hashimoto, Yoshio] Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Urakami, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.; Urakami, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, 4-17-1 Wakasato, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",urakami@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19K15455]; Murata Science Foundation; Alumni Association ""Wakasatokai"" of the Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University","This study was partially supported by Grant-in-Aid for Early-Career Scientist #19K15455 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, by a research grant from the Murata Science Foundation, and by the Alumni Association ""Wakasatokai"" of the Faculty of Engineering, Shinshu University.

However, weaning protocols have not significantly affected mortality or reintubation rates. The extubation process is a critical component of respiratory care in patients who receive MV. Post-extubation respiratory failure (PERF) is a common event associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that a comprehensive protocol for ventilator weaning and extubation would be effective for preventing PERF and reintubation and reducing mortality in critically ill patients.MethodsA ventilator weaning and extubation protocol was developed. The protocol consisted of checklists across four evaluations: spontaneous breathing trial, extubation, prophylactic non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), and evaluation after extubation. Observational data were collected after implementing the protocol in patients admitted to the Advanced Emergency and Critical Care Center of Shinshu University Hospital. Not only outcomes of patients but also influences of each component of the protocol on the clinical decision-making process were investigated. Further, a comparison between PERF and non-PERF patients was performed.ResultsA total of 464 consecutive patients received MV for more than 48h, and 248 (77 women; mean age, 6517years) were deemed eligible. The overall PERF and reintubation rates were 9.7% and 5.2%, respectively. Overall, 54.1% of patients with PERF received reintubation. Hospital stay and mortality were not significantly different between PERF and non-PERF patients (p=0.16 and 0.057, respectively). As a result, the 28-day and hospital mortality were 1.2% and 6.9%, respectively.Conclusions p id=Par4 We found that the rates of PERF, reintubation, and hospital mortality were lower than those in previous reports even with nearly the same degree of severity at extubation. The comprehensive protocol for ventilator weaning and extubation may prevent PERF and reintubation and reduce mortality in critically ill patients.","[Nitta, Kenichi; Okamoto, Kazufumi; Imamura, Hiroshi; Mochizuki, Katsunori; Takayama, Hiroshi; Kamijo, Hiroshi; Okada, Mayumi; Takeshige, Kanako; Kashima, Yuichiro; Satou, Takahisa] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Emergency & Crit Care Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Nitta, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Emergency & Crit Care Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",nittaken@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,32,0,0,5,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2052-0492,,,J INTENSIVE CARE,J.

Materials and Methods This investigation included three sub-studies to demonstrate urine flow in the entire LUT. First, we attempted to observe vorticity generation in the urinary bladder during spontaneous voiding using transabdominal color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS). Second, we performed transrectal CDUS to evaluate the vorticity of urine flow in the prostatic urethra. Patients with prostate cancer were enrolled before robotic surgery and divided into the vorticity and non-vorticity groups based on CDUS findings for comparisons of longitudinal urethral diameter and prostatic urethral angle. Third, the vorticity of the voided urine stream was observed using a high-speed video-camera. Micturition was done in a standing position while synchronously monitored for urine flow using uroflowmetry. Results Vorticity formation could be dynamically demonstrated in the urinary bladder and prostatic urethra using CDUS. The prostatic urethral angle of the vorticity group was more than that of the non-vorticity group. High-speed video recording could clearly capture vorticity and spiral shape generation in voided urine. The distance from the external urethral orifice to the first twist changed in accordance with urine flow rate. Conclusions In a series of sub-studies, this investigation proved vorticity generation in the LUT and voided urine. Vorticity was detectable in the LUT and in voided urine using CDUS and a high-speed video-camera. Vorticity generation might be associated with urethral morphology.","[Minagawa, Tomonori; Tezuka, Masato; Ogawa, Teruyuki; Ishizuka, Osamu] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Urol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Minagawa, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Urol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",minagawat@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,29,0,0,1,1,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0733-2467,1520-6777,,NEUROUROL URODYNAM,Neurourol.

Variation in both the etiology of ARDS and patient factors has resulted in inconsistent application of NPPV. We have developed a protocol-based NPPV strategy as a first-line intervention for ARDS. The aim of this observational study was to determine if protocol-based NPPV improves the outcome in patients with ARDS. MethodsWe identified patients with ARDS treated by protocol-based NPPV at our institution between March 2006 and March 2010 and categorized them according to NPPV success or failure. Success was defined as avoidance of intubation and remaining alive during NPPV. ResultsEighty-eight of 169 patients diagnosed with ARDS during the study period were treated using the protocol. Fifty-two (76%) of 68 patients who were eligible for the study were successfully treated and did not require endotracheal intubation. The overall mortality rate at 28 days after initiation of NPPV was 12%. The mortality rate was significantly lower in the success group than in the failure group (P < 0.01). The PaO2/FiO(2) ratio after 12-24 h of NPPV was significantly higher in the success group than in the failure group (202 63 versus 145 +/- 46; P < 0.01). ConclusionsThe success rate was higher and the mortality was lower in patients than in historical controls.

SFNF has been intensively investigated for various textile industries for different applications such as smart wearables, surgical gowns and advanced apparels. UA dyeing at room temperature resulted in enhanced color yield with production time saving up to 60% in comparison to conventional dyeing, which ultimately showed saving of 62.28% electrical and 64.28% thermal energy consumption. SEM images revealed smooth morphology and lesser shrinkage before and after UA dyeing of SFNF. WAXD, wicking and water contact angle showed amorphous behavior and enhanced wettability of UA-dyed SFNF. Chemical changes of dyed SFNF were confirmed using FTIR and XPS. The proposed UA dyeing of SFNF has a great energy-saving potential as well as high production rate, and therefore can be utilized for advanced apparels.","[Khatri, Muzamil; Hussain, Nadir; Yamamoto, Takayuki; Khatri, Zeeshan; Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fusion Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Khatri, Zeeshan; Ahmed, Farooq] Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Ctr Excellence Nanotechnol & Mat, Jamshoro 76060, Sindh, Pakistan; [El-Ghazali, Sofia; Kobayashi, Shunichi] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biomed Engn, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Khatri, Z; Kim, IS (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Nano Fusion Technol Res Grp,Div Frontier Fibers, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Khatri, Z (reprint author), Mehran Univ Engn & Technol, Ctr Excellence Nanotechnol & Mat, Jamshoro 76060, Sindh, Pakistan.",zeeshan.khatri@faculty.muet.edu.pk; kim@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Khatri, Zeeshan/J-3977-2014","Khatri, Zeeshan/0000-0001-8779-3805","Shinshu University, Japan","This work was supported by Shinshu University, Japan.",,39,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",2190-5509,2190-5517,,APPL NANOSCI,Appl.

We aimed to explore whether certain root traits are consistent among subsets of species and characterize species together into meaningful community groups. We selected 11 woody species from different microbial symbiotic groups (ectomycorrhiza, arbuscular mycorrhiza, and rhizobia) and phylogenetic groups (broad-leaved angiosperms and coniferous gymnosperms) from the cool temperate forests of Nagano, Japan. We measured root architectural (branching intensity), morphological (root tissue density and specific root length), chemical (N and K concentrations), and anatomical (total stele and total cortex) traits. Significant differences were observed in all root traits, although many species did not differ from one another. Branching intensity was found to be the greatest variation in the measured root traits across the 11 woody species. The results of a principal component analysis of root traits showed a distinct separation between angiosperms and gymnosperms. We identified clusters of species based on their multidimensional root traits that were consistent with the different phylogenetic microbial association groups. Gymnosperm roots may be more resource conservative, while angiosperm roots may be more acquisitive for water and nutrients. We consider that the advances in root traits combination will make a breakthrough in our ability to differentiate the community groups rather than individual root trait.","[Yahara, Hikari; Tanikawa, Natsuko; Okamoto, Mizuki; Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Makita, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",macky@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Fujiwara Natural History Foundation [15K18719, 18K14488]","This study was partially funded by Grant-in Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science fellows (15K18719, 18K14488) and by the Fujiwara Natural History Foundation.",,46,1,1,16,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0029-8549,1432-1939,,OECOLOGIA,Oecologia,DEC,2019,191,4,,,,,983,993,,10.1007/s00442-019-04546-2,,19-Nov,11,Ecology,Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JM7TP,WOS:000493686800002,31679040,,,,2020/4/20

The CALET mission was conceived to address several outstanding questions of high-energy astroparticle physics, like indirect detection of dark matter, the origin of cosmic rays (CRs), their mechanisms of acceleration and galactic propagation, the presence of possible nearby astrophysical CR sources. That can be achieved by precise measurements of the fluxes of CR electrons and gamma rays up to the unexplored region above 1 TeV, and the energy spectra and composition of CR nuclei from a few tens of GeV to hundreds of TeV. In order to perform these observations, the instrument combines a thick total absorption PWO crystal calorimeter for energy measurement, a scintillator hodoscope for charge identification and thin imaging tungsten-scintillating fiber calorimeter providing accurate particle tracking and complementary charge measurement. In this paper, we will present an overview of the main CALET results based on the data collected in the first three years of the mission.","[Maestro, P.; Bigongiari, G.; Brogi, P.; Marrocchesi, P.

However, a mechanism for its expression and activation in the tissue has remained unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that IL-1 beta transcript was enriched in neutrophils of white adipose tissue (WAT) from lean mice. Mechanistically, the interaction of neutrophils with adipocytes induced IL-1 beta expression via NF-kappa B pathway. Lipolysis of adipocytes accumulated neutrophils prior to macrophages in WAT and produced high levels of IL-1 beta via an inflammasome pathway. Leukotriene B-4 (LTB4) production in WAT also contributed to neutrophil accumulation. Furthermore, an LTB4-inflammasome axis contributed to the expression of chemotactic molecules involved in high-fat diet-induced macrophage infiltration into WAT. We have identified previously unappreciated roles for neutrophils in the development of adipose tissue inflammation: robust IL-1 beta production and infiltration of macrophages to initiate chronic inflammation.","[Watanabe, Yasuharu; Nagai, Yoshinori; Honda, Hiroe; Okamoto, Naoki; Yanagibashi, Tsutomu; Takatsu, Kiyoshi] Univ Toyama, Dept Immunobiol & Pharmacol Genet, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Toyama, Japan; [Yamamoto, Seiji; Sasahara, Masakiyo] Univ Toyama, Dept Pathol, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Toyama, Japan; [Takasaki, Ichiro] Univ Toyama, Dept Pharmacol, Grad Sch Med & Pharmaceut Sci, Toyama, Japan; [Watanabe, Yasuharu; Honda, Hiroe; Yanagibashi, Tsutomu; Ogasawara, Masaru; Takatsu, Kiyoshi] Toyama Prefectural Inst Pharmaceut Res, 17-1 Nakataikouyama, Toyama 9390363, Japan; [Nagai, Yoshinori] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy JST, Precursory Res Embryon Sci & Technol PRESTO, Tokyo, Japan; [Nagai, Yoshinori] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Engn, Fac Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Toyama 9390398, Japan; [Okamoto, Naoki] Teika Pharmaceut Co, Toyama, Japan; [Imamura, Ryu; Suda, Takashi] Kanazawa Univ, Div Immunol & Mol Biol, Canc Res Inst, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan; [Hara, Hiromitsu] Kagoshima Univ, Grad Sch Med & Dent Sci, Dept Immunol, Kagoshima, Japan; [Arita, Makoto] Riken Ctr Integrat Med Sci IMS, Lab Metabol, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Arita, Makoto] Yokohama Univ, Grad Sch Med Life Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Arita, Makoto] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Div Physiol Chem & Metab, Tokyo, Japan; [Taniguchi, Shun'ichiro] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol & Cellular Hlth Sci, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Taniguchi, Shun'ichiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Comprehens Canc Therapy, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Imamura, Ryu] Kanazawa Univ, Div Tumor Dynam & Regulat, Canc Res Inst, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan","Takatsu, K (reprint author), Toyama Prefectural Inst Pharmaceut Res, 17-1 Nakataikouyama, Toyama 9390363, Japan.; Nagai, Y (reprint author), Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Pharmaceut Engn, Fac Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Toyama 9390398, Japan.",ynagai@pu-toyama.ac.jp; kiyoshi.takatsu@pref.toyama.lg.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS Kakenhi)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K19532, JP15K08527]; Presto, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)Japan Science & Technology Agency (JST); Hokuriku Life Science Cluster, Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Regional Innovation Strategy Support Program; Takeda Science FoundationTakeda Science Foundation (TSF); First Bank of Toyama Scholarship Foundation; Tokyo Biochemical Research Foundation","The authors thank all members of the University of Toyama and Toyama Prefectural Institute for Pharmaceutical Research laboratories for helpful discussions.

The Wnt signaling pathway can be classified into two main pathways: canonical and non-canonical. Of these, the canonical Wnt signaling pathway promotes osteogenesis. Sclerostin produced by osteocytes is an inhibitor of this pathway, thereby inhibiting osteogenesis. Recently, osteoporosis treatment using an anti-sclerostin therapy has been introduced. In this review, the basics of Wnt signaling, its role in bone metabolism and its involvement in skeletal disorders have been covered. Furthermore, the clinical significance and future scopes of Wnt signaling in osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and neoplasia are discussed.","[Maeda, Kazuhiro; Kayama, Tomohiro; Saito, Mitsuru; Marumo, Keishi] Jikei Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Minato Ku, 3-25-8 Nishi Shimbashi, Tokyo 1058461, Japan; [Kobayashi, Yasuhiro; Koide, Masanori] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Inst Oral Sci, 1780 Gohara Hiro Oka, Shiojiri, Nagano 3990781, Japan; [Uehara, Shunsuke] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Dept Biochem, 1780 Gohara Hiro Oka, Shiojiri, Nagano 3990781, Japan; [Okamoto, Masanori] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Ishihara, Akihiro] Hiruma Dent Clin, Katsushika Ku, 5-34-16-4F Kameari, Tokyo 1250061, Japan","Maeda, K (reprint author), Jikei Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, Minato Ku, 3-25-8 Nishi Shimbashi, Tokyo 1058461, Japan.",maeda@jikei.ac.jp; yasuhiro.kobayashi@mdu.ac.jp; masanori.koide@mdu.ac.jp; shunsuke.uehara@mdu.ac.jp; ryouyuma@shinshu-u.ac.jp; akistep40@gmail.com; tom_kayama@jikei.ac.jp; xlink67@gol.com; marumo@jikei.ac.jp,,"Okamoto, Masanori/0000-0003-0351-865X; Kobayashi, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-0903-3226; Koide, Masanori/0000-0002-6511-9999","Ministry of Education, Cultures, Sports, Science and Technology of JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [18K16161]","This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKEN) 18K16161 (Ka.M.) from the Ministry of Education, Cultures, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.",,226,2,2,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

REDUCTION; TARGETS; DISEASE; EVENTS,"IMPORTANCE The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated that a systolic blood pressure (BP) target less than 120 mm Hg was superior to less than 140 mm Hg for preventing vascular events. This trial excluded patients with prior stroke; therefore, the ideal BP target for secondary stroke prevention remains unknown. OBJECTIVE To assess whether intensive BP control would achieve fewer recurrent strokes vs standard BP control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial (RCT) of standard vs intensive BP control in an intent-to-treat population of patients who had a history of stroke. Patients were enrolled between October 20, 2010, and December 7, 2016. For an updated meta-analysis, PubMed and the Cochrane Central Library database were searched through September 30, 2018, using the Medical Subject Headings and relevant search terms for cerebrovascular disease and for intensive BP lowering. This was a multicenter trial that included 140 hospitals in Japan; 1514 patients who had a history of stroke within the previous 3 years were approached, but 234 refused to give informed consent. INTERVENTIONS In total, 1280 patients were randomized 1:1 to BP control to less than 140/90 mm Hg (standard treatment) (n=640) or to less than 120/80 mm Hg (intensive treatment) (n=640). However, 17 patients never received intervention; therefore, 1263 patients assigned to standard treatment (n=630) or intensive treatment (n=633) were analyzed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was stroke recurrence. RESULTS The trial was stopped early. Among 1263 analyzed patients (mean [SD] age, 67.2 [8.8] years; 69.4% male), 1257 of 1263 (99.5%) completed a mean (SD) of 3.9 (1.5) years of follow-up. The mean BP at baseline was 145.4/83.6 mm Hg. Throughout the overall follow-up period, the mean BP was 133.2/77.7 (95% CI, 132.5-133.8/77.1-78.4) mm Hg in the standard group and 126.7/77.4 (95% CI, 125.9-127.2/73.8-75.0) mm Hg in the intensive group. Ninety-one first recurrent strokes occurred. Nonsignificant rate reductions were seen for recurrent stroke in the intensive group compared with the standard group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.49-1.11; P=.15). When this finding was pooled in 3 previous relevant RCTs in a meta-analysis, the risk ratio favored intensive BP control (relative risk, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96; P=.02; absolute risk difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -2.6% to -0.4%; number needed to treat, 67; 95% CI, 39-250). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intensive BP lowering tended to reduce stroke recurrence. The updated meta-analysis supports a target BP less than 130/80 mm Hg in secondary stroke prevention.","[Kitagawa, Kazuo] Tokyo Womens Med Univ, Dept Neurol, Shinjuku Ku, 8-1 Kawada Cho, Tokyo 1628666, Japan;

The methods of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) were applied to the characterization of ZnO NPs. Polypropylene (PP)/ZnO fiber was prepared using 1-5 wt% ZnO NPs via melt spinning. The ultraviolet light (UV)-degradation behavior, antibacterial activity and mechanical properties of PP fibers were characterized. The PP fiber filled with ZnO NPs presents better mechanical properties and the resistance to UV light degradation. For the best effect, the contents of ZnO NPs were set 4 wt% in PP fiber. FTIR analysis shows significant photo-degradation of PP induced by UV irradiation and a remarkable reduction in the UV degradation of the fiber filled with ZnO NPs. It is also observed that the ZnO NPs-filled fiber has good antibacterial actives against Escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus.","[Zhang, Guangyu; Xiao, Yao; Xie, Ningwei; Liu, Rong; Zhang, Yu] Nantong Univ, Sch Text & Clothing, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Tech Fiber Compos, Nantong 226019, Peoples R China; [Yan, Jiawei] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Liu, R (reprint author), Nantong Univ, Sch Text & Clothing, Natl & Local Joint Engn Res Ctr Tech Fiber Compos, Nantong 226019, Peoples R China.",zgyu85@ntu.edu.cn; xyt123asd@163.com; 19fs110c@shinshu-u.ac.jp; ningweixie@163.com; rong063@ntu.edu.cn; z.yu@ntu.edu.cn,,,National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFB0303101]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51503105],"The present work was supported financially by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2016YFB0303101), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51503105).",,31,0,0,6,6,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,NOV,2019,11,11,,,,,,,1841,10.3390/polym11111841,,,10,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JW8EE,WOS:000503279200113,31717340,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

Recently, we reported that eggplant was rich in choline esters, including acetylcholine (ACh), and had an antihypertensive effect in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Here, we evaluated the effects of a continuous intake of eggplant powder on blood pressure (BP), stress, and psychological state (PS) in 100 stressed participants with normal-high BP or grade 1 hypertension in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group comparative study. The participants were randomly assigned to the eggplant or placebo group. Participants in the eggplant group ingested capsules containing eggplant powder (1.2 g/day; 2.3 mg of ACh/day) for 12 weeks, whereas participants in the placebo group ingested placebo capsules. The primary outcome assessed was hospital BP. Secondary outcomes were stress and PS.

It also improved negative PSs at week 8 or 12 in the normal-high BP group. This is the first evidence of the BP- and PS-improving effects of eggplant intake in humans.

Distilled water was used to obtain the homogenous dispersion of Rh-nanoclusters on graphene platelets. The morphology of the resultant catalyst (Rh(0)NCs/GNPs) was studied by means of transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) analyses. The X-ray photoemission spectroscope (XPS) result confirmed the metallic form of Rh-nanoclusters in Rh(0)NCs/GNPs. The crystalline property and the interaction between Rh-nanoclusters and graphene platelets (GNPs) were studied by means of XRD and Raman analysis. The Rh-loading in Rh(0)NCs/GNPs was confirmed by scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectroscope (SEM-EDS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscope (ICP-MS) analysis. After being optimized, the Rh(0)NCs/GNPs used as catalyst for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with NaBH4 and the Sonogashira coupling reaction between iodobenzene with phenylacetylene. To our delight, the Rh(0)NCs/GNPs showed excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of 4-nitrophenol with an excellent turnover frequency (TOF) value of 112.5 min(-1). The k(app) and k' values were calculated to be 62.07 x 10(-3) min(-1)(0.002 mg of Rh(0)NCs/GNPs) and 31035 x 10(-3) mg(-1) min(-1),respectively. Alike, under the optimal conditions, the Rh(0)NCs/GNPs gave the desired product, diphenylacetylene, in a good yield of 87% with 91% selectivity. The Rh(0)NCs/GNPs can be reused without significant loss in its catalytic activity.","[Mayakrishnan, Gopiraman; Min, Chung Ill] Konkuk Univ, Coll Sanghur Life Sci, Dept Crop Sci, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Somasundaram, Saravanamoorthy; Andivelu, Ilangovan] Bharathidasan Univ, Sch Chem, Tiruchirappalli 620024, Tamil Nadu, India; [Ullah, Sana; Soo, Kim Ick] Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Div Frontier Fibers,Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Soo, KI (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, ICCER, Inst Fiber Engn IFES, Div Frontier Fibers,Nano Fus Technol Res Grp, Tokida 3-15-1, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",gopiramannitt@gmail.com; saraartudc@gmail.com; sanamalik269@gmail.com; ilangovan@bdu.ac.in; kimicksoo.gr@gmail.com; illminchung@gmail.com,,"Ick Soo, Kim/0000-0003-2244-4369; Ullah, Sana/0000-0001-6628-143X; Mayakrishnan, Gopiraman/0000-0002-0137-8617",Konkuk University KU research professor program,This study was supported by Konkuk University KU research professor program.,,57,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4344,,CATALYSTS,Catalysts,NOV,2019,9,11,,,,,,,908,10.3390/catal9110908,,,18,"Chemistry, Physical",Chemistry,JV3PS,WOS:000502278800034,,DOAJ Gold,,,2020/4/20

The modified Glasgow prognostic score (mGPS) has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor in various tumors. However, there have been few reports regarding the prognostic value of mGPS in extensive disease (ED)-SCLC. Objective: This study was designed to clarify the clinical significance of mGPS focusing on its usefulness as a prognostic indicator for the survival and serial administrations of chemotherapies in patients with ED-SCLC. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of ED-SCLC patients diagnosed and treated at Shinshu University School of Medicine between January 2005 and December 2018. Overall survival (OS) was compared according to mGPS and we examined whether mGPS could be a prognostic factor in ED-SCLC using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate and multivariate Cox hazard analyses. Results: Eighty-three patients were enrolled in this study. The median OS of mGPS 0, mGPS 1, and mGPS 2 groups were 13.6, 9.2, and 5.7 months, respectively. The OS of the mGPS 0 group was significantly longer than those of mGPS 1 and mGPS 2 groups (log-rank, p = 0.025 and 0.008, respectively). The rates of second-line chemotherapy administration in mGPS 0, mGPS 1, and mGPS 2 groups were 79.4, 61.9, and 33.3%, respectively. The rate in the mGPS 0 group was significantly higher than that in the mGPS 2 group (p = 0.003). Multivariate analyses indicated that mGPS 2 was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in addition to old age (>= 75 years), poor performance status (2-3), and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level (>= 223 IU/L). Conclusion: In ED-SCLC patients, mGPS was useful as a prognostic indicator for OS.","[Sonehara, Kei; Tateishi, Kazunari; Komatsu, Masamichi; Yamamoto, Hiroshi; Hanaoka, Masayuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Internal Med 1, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kanda, Shintaro; Koizumi, Tomonobu] Shinshu Univ, Dept Comprehens Canc Therapy, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi Matsumoto, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Koizumi, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Comprehens Canc Therapy, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi Matsumoto, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tomonobu@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"koizumi, Tomonobu/0000-0002-5182-0960",,,,32,1,1,1,1,KARGER,BASEL,"ALLSCHWILERSTRASSE 10, CH-4009 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",0009-3157,1421-9794,,CHEMOTHERAPY,Chemotherapy,NOV,2019,64,3,,,,,129,137,,10.1159/000502681,,,9,Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,Oncology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy,JU6WN,WOS:000501814700003,31622969,,,,2020/4/20

We identified an ATTR-wt-specific morbidity rate of 12.3% for patients over 80 years of age, while the prevalence among individuals over 90 years of age was 34.9%. In none of these 32 cases had a clinical diagnosis of ATTR-wt been made. In 29 of the 32 cases found to be ATTR-wt positive, an obvious extraneous cause of death was identified and included burning, drowning, hypothermia, suicide, and traffic accident.

Seven influent samples were collected from three WWTPs in Nagano Prefecture, Japan, during August and December 2018. Colistin-resistant E. coli isolates were selected on colistin-supplemented CHROMagar ECC plates. mcr-1-positive isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis. From six influent samples, seven mcr-1-positive but extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-negative isolates belonging to different genetic lineages, namely, B2-O25:H4-ST131-fimH22, B2-O2:H1-ST135-fimH2, B1-O8:H9-ST764-fimH32, B1-O23:H16-5T453-fimH31, A-O81: H27-ST10-fimH54, A-O16:H5-ST871-fimH25, and F-O11:H6-ST457-fimH145, were detected. The MICs of colistin for these isolates ranged from 4 to 16 mg/liter. The mcr-1 genes were located on plasmids belonging to IncX4 and Incl2 in five and two isolates, respectively. Four IncX4 plasmids with the same size (33,309 bp) showed high sequence similarity (4 single-nucleotide variations). The remaining one IncX4 plasmid, with a size of 33,858 bp, carried the mcr-1 gene with the single synonymous nucleic substitution T27C. Two Incl2 plasmids with sizes of 60,710 bp and 60,733 bp had high sequence similarity (99.9% identity; 100% query coverage). Two of five isolates carrying IncX4 plasmids and both of the isolates carrying Incl2 plasmids harbored CoIV plasmids carrying virulence-associated genes of avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC). In addition, another isolate of the B2-O25:H4-ST131-fimH22 lineage had those APEC-associated virulence genes on its chromosome. In conclusion, mcr-1-positive E. coli environmental isolates were mostly characterized as positive for APEC-associated virulence genes. The copresence of those genes may suggest the existence of a common source in animals and/or their associated environments. IMPORTANCE Colistin is considered a last-line therapeutic option in severe infections due to multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, in particular carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. An increasing prevalence of mcr genes in diverse Enterobacteriaceae species, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from humans and food animals, has become a significant concern to public health all over the world. In Japan, mcr genes have so far been detected in food animals, raw meat, wastewater, and human clinical samples. This study reports the copresence of mcr-1 and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC)-associated virulence genes in five of seven E. coli isolates recovered from aquatic environments in Japan. Our study highlights the importance and urgency of action to reduce environmental contamination by mcr genes that may likely occur due to exposure to untreated wastewater through combined sewer overflow by recent unusual weather.","[Hayashi, Wataru; Nagano, Noriyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tanaka, Hayato; Taniguchi, Yui; Iimura, Masaki; Soga, Eiji; Nagano, Noriyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Grad Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Kubo, Ryoichi] Kanto Chem Co Inc, Tokyo, Japan; [Matsuo, Nao; Kawamura, Kumiko] Nagoya Univ, Dept Pathophysiol Lab Sci, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Arakawa, Yoshichika; Nagano, Yukiko] Nagoya Univ, Dept Bacteriol, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Nagano, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.; Nagano, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Grad Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",naganon@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Arakawa, Yoshichika/P-5997-2015","Hayashi, Wataru/0000-0003-3430-8524","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18K08428]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant number JP18K08428.,,44,1,1,6,6,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

This study focused on Escherichia coli possessing bla(CTX-M) genes in wastewater inflows. Twelve crude inflow water samples from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) A and two samples each from three other WWTPs were collected in 2017 and 2018. A total of 73 E. coli isolates with 31 different sequence types (STs) harboring distinctive bla(CTX-M) gene repertoires were detected. In WWTP A influents, bla(CTX-M-14) (14 isolates) was dominant, followed by bla(CTX-M-15 )(12 isolates) and bla(CTX-M-27) (10 isolates). The chimeric bla(CTX-M-)(64) and bla(CTX-M-123) genes were each identified in one of the E. coli isolates from the same WWTP A inflow port. The bla(CTX-M-27) gene was associated with five of seven B2-ST131 isolates, including three isolates of the B2-O25b-ST131-H30R/non-Rx lineage. One of the remaining two isolates belonged to the B2-O25b-ST131-H30R/Rx lineage harboring the bla(CTX-M-15) gene. As for the B2-025b-ST131-H30R/non-Rx lineage, two isolates with bla(CTX-M-27) were recovered from each of the WWTP B and D influents, and one isolate with bla(CTX-M-174) was also recovered from WWTP B influent. Whole-genome sequencing of chimeric bla(CTX-M) -harboring E. coli isolates revealed that the bla(CTX-M-64) gene was integrated into the chromosome of ST10 E. coli B22 via ISEcp1-mediated transposition of a 9,467-bp sequence. The bla(CTX-M-123)-carrying Incl1 plasmid pB64 was 109,169 bp in length with pST108. The overall findings suggest that wastewater may act as a probable reservoir of clinically significant clonal lineages mediating antimicrobial resistance genes and chimeric genes that have not yet been identified from human isolates of domestic origin in Japan. IMPORTANCE Global spread of CTX-M-type extended-spectrum p-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceoe is a critical concern in both clinical and community settings. This dominance of CTX-M-type ESBL producers may be largely due to the successful international spread of epidemic clones, as represented by the extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichla coli (ExPEC) ST131. Our findings highlight the worrisome presence of diverse E. coli clones associated with humans, including ExPEC lineages harboring the most common bla(CTX-M) variants in untreated wastewater samples. Moreover, the chimeric genes bla(CTX-M-)(64) and bla(CTX-M-123), which have not yet been identified from human isolates of domestic origin in Japan, were identified. Exposure to untreated wastewater through combined sewer overflow caused by heavy rains derived from abnormal weather change could pose a risk for human health due to ingesting those antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.","[Tanaka, Hayato; Iimura, Masaki; Taniguchi, Yui; Soga, Eiji; Nagano, Noriyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Grad Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Hayashi, Wataru; Nagano, Noriyuki] Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Matsuo, Nao; Kawamura, Kumiko] Nagoya Univ, Dept Pathophysiol Lab Sci, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Arakawa, Yoshichika; Nagano, Yukiko] Nagoya Univ, Dept Bacteriol, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan","Nagano, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Hlth & Med Sci, Grad Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.; Nagano, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",naganon@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Arakawa, Yoshichika/P-5997-2015","Hayashi, Wataru/0000-0003-3430-8524","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP18K08428]",This study was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant JP18K08428.,,40,0,0,3,3,AMER SOC MICROBIOLOGY,WASHINGTON,"1752 N ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036-2904 USA",0099-2240,1098-5336,,APPL ENVIRON MICROB,Appl.

We examined the prospective association between social support and cognitive function among community-dwelling older people. Japanese adults recruited at health checkups in suburban towns were surveyed at baseline and one-year follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Japanese version (MoCA-J). Social support from coresiding family, non-coresiding family, and neighbors/friends was assessed using self-administered questionnaires. Multivariable linear regression analysis was conducted to examine the effects of social support on MoCA-J scores at follow-up. Data were analyzed from 121 older people (mean age (standard deviation): 73.86 (4.95) years). There was a positive association between social support exchanges with neighbors and friends and MoCA-J scores at follow-up after covariate adjustment (unstandardized beta = 1.23, p = 0.006). Social support exchanges with coresiding family and non-coresiding family and relatives were not associated with MoCA-J scores at follow-up (coresiding family: Unstandardized beta = 0.28, p = 0.813, non-coresiding family and relatives: Unstandardized beta = 0.51, p = 0.238). The provision of emotional support to neighbors and friends had the largest effect on MoCA-J scores. Our findings suggest that social support exchanges with neighbors and friends are protective against cognitive decline.","[Noguchi, Taiji] Natl Ctr Geriatr & Gerontol, Dept Social Sci, Ctr Gerontol & Social Sci, Obu, Aichi 4748511, Japan; [Noguchi, Taiji] Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Nagoya, Aichi 4678601, Japan; [Nojima, Ippei] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch, Dept Hlth Sci, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Inoue-Hirakawa, Tomoe; Sugiura, Hideshi] Nagoya Univ, Dept Phys Therapy, Grad Sch Med, Nagoya, Aichi 4618673, Japan","Noguchi, T (reprint author), Natl Ctr Geriatr & Gerontol, Dept Social Sci, Ctr Gerontol & Social Sci, Obu, Aichi 4748511, Japan.; Noguchi, T (reprint author), Nagoya City Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Nagoya, Aichi 4678601, Japan.",noguchi.taiji0415@gmail.com; nojima@shinshu-u.ac.jp; inoue@met.nagoya-u.ac.jp; hsugiura@met.nagoya-u.ac.jp,,"Noguchi, Taiji/0000-0001-9165-5501","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18H03127, 17H04748]; Japanese Physical Therapy Association [H30-A43]; Mayekawa Hitodukuri Foundation [MHF2019-B001]","This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), No. 18H03127 and Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A), No. 17H04748), the Japanese Physical Therapy Association (No. H30-A43), and the Mayekawa Hitodukuri Foundation (No. MHF2019-B001).

SHISA3 blocks the maturation and transportation of Frizzled receptors to the cell surface, thereby inhibiting the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in lung cancer. However, the function of Shisa3 in bone biology remains uninvestigated. This study found that Shisa3 was strongly expressed in the calvarial bones of mice, especially in osteoblasts. In addition, adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of murine Shisa3 significantly inhibited Wnt3a-induced nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and mRNA expression of the Wnt target gene Axin2. In bone phenotype assessments of Shisa3 knockout (Shisa3 KO) mice, micro-computed tomography, mRNA expressions of osteoblast markers, and skeletal preparations all displayed no significant differences compared with Shisa3 wild-type mice. mRNA expression analysis of canonical Wnt signaling target genes (Axin2, Lef1, Dkk1, and Tnfrsf11b) in calvarial bones at P0.5 also revealed no significant findings. In Axin2(Cre/ERT2) knock-in mice, the number of Axin2-expressing cells in the calvariae of Shisa3 KO and control mice were comparable. Thus, there appears to be a redundancy in the function of Shisa3 in bone development, likely with other Shisa family members.","[Murakami, Kohei] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Radiol, 1780 Gobara, Hirooka, Shiojiri 3990781, Japan; [He Zhifeng; Kobayashi, Yasuhiro] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Inst Oral Sci, Shiojiri, Nagano, Japan; [Suzuki, Takako; Nakamura, Yukio] Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Nakamura, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Orthopaed Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",yxn14@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Murakami, Kohei/0000-0001-5458-410X",,,,25,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"SHIROYAMA TRUST TOWER 5F, 4-3-1 TORANOMON, MINATO-KU, TOKYO, 105-6005, JAPAN",0914-8779,1435-5604,,J BONE MINER METAB,J.

In a Facebook post we presented the project to reveal where the two species occur in Budapest, together with an identification guide which included images. In this study we compiled information received in the two months following the Facebook post. We obtained 44, 92 and 105 locality observations of H. lucorum, the native H. pomatia and C. aspersum, respectively in the city, mostly within five days after the post. Our Realtime Social Networking Service (RSNS) method, which included intensive communication with citizen scientists, revealed that C. aspersum was spread in most areas across Budapest, except for the Buda region west of the Danube where H. lucorum dominates. Their distributions overlapped with each other only in small ranges. We found that no specimens of these non-indigenous species were present in the collection of L. Drimmer, who extensively collected land snails in the city in the early 1990s. Accordingly, the two non-indigenous species most probably established their current distributions in Budapest in the last 30 years. Our study demonstrates that RSNS method efficiently and rapidly reveals distributions of relatively large animal species in city areas and provides a dependable basis for further research.","[Pall-Gergely, Barna] Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Herman Otto St 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Majoros, Gabor; Juhasz, Alexandra] Univ Vet Med, Dept Parasitol & Zool, Istvan U 2, H-1078 Budapest, Hungary; [Domokos, Tamas] Burok U 24-26E, H-1124 Budapest, Hungary; [Turoci, Agnes] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Herman Otto St 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary; [Badacsonyi, Laszlo] Gardonyi U 15, H-3060 Paszto, Hungary; [Fekete, Judit] Univ Pannonia, Dept Limnol, Egyet U 10, H-8200 Veszprem, Hungary; [Asami, Takahiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Biol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan","Pall-Gergely, B (reprint author), Ctr Agr Res, Plant Protect Inst, Herman Otto St 15, H-1022 Budapest, Hungary.",pall-gergely.barna@agrar.mta.hu; Majoros.Gabor@univet.hu; tamasdomokos@freemail.hu; juhasz.alexandra89@gmail.com; turoci.agnes@agrar.mta.hu; labadacs@freemail.hu; juditfekete0307@gmail.com; asami99@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Pall-Gergely, Barna/H-5943-2011","Pall-Gergely, Barna/0000-0002-6167-7221","MTA (Hungarian Academy of Sciences) Premium Post Doctorate Research Program; Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","We are grateful to all the participants who sent information on land snail occurrences and indicated their names after each locality in the Table S1.

Although the ROPs catalyzed by tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate [Sn(Oct)(2)] and 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) did not yield polymeric products, diphenyl phosphate (DPP) functioned a catalyst for the ROP through acyl scission accompanying with the elimination of acetaldehyde at 50 degrees C and 80 degrees C. The resulting polymer was a poly(conjugated ester) that had similar structure to the polymer of alpha-methylene-beta-butyrolactone (M beta BL), an alpha-exomethylene lactone with four-membered ring. Copolymerizations of epsilon-caprolactone and delta-valerolactone were also performed to yield the corresponding polyesters. The chemoselective main chain scission of the copolymers at the conjugated ester units were achieved by conjugate substitution reaction with benzyl mercaptan. Although the ROP of DMDO left a problem in the control of molecular weight, DMDO exhibited a potential as an easier accessible monomer alternative to M beta BL for the preparation of bio- and chemo-degradable polyesters.","[Kohsaka, Yasuhiro] Shinshu Univ, RISM, Ueda, Nagano, Japan; [Kohsaka, Yasuhiro; Yamashita, Mai; Matsuhashi, Yosuke; Yamashita, Shuji] Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Kohsaka, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, RISM, Ueda, Nagano, Japan.; Kohsaka, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",kohsaka@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI grantMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16K05792, 19H02763]; Tokuyama Science Foundation; Ube Industries Research Foundation: The UBE Foundation","The donation of acryloyl chloride from the Iharanikkei Chemical Industry Co., Ltd is gratefully acknowledged.

METHODS: The Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus database registered the records of 2835 patients collected from 32 Japanese institutions from 1991 to 2010. The cumulative incidence function of death due to extrathymic malignancies or recurrence was calculated, with other causes of death as competing risks. Relevant risk factors associated with extrathymic malignancy-related deaths in patients with thymoma were evaluated using the Fine and Gray model. RESULTS: In total, 2701 patients were eligible for the analysis (thymoma, 2374; thymic carcinoma, 273; thymic neuroendocrine tumour, 54). The median follow-up period was 4.6years. The cumulative incidence function of death due to extrathymic malignancies at 10years was 2.2% (3.2% due to recurrence) in patients with thymoma, 1.6% (38.6% due to recurrence) in patients with thymic carcinoma and 0% (36.6% due to recurrence) in patients with thymic neuroendocrine tumour. In the multivariable analysis, age (every 10years) at thymectomy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.19, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.53-3.14; P<0.001], male gender (HR 2.62, 95% CI 1.19-5.77; P=0.017) and previous malignancies (HR 3.09, 95% CI 1.18-8.11; P=0.022) were significant factors for death due to extrathymic malignancies after thymectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Continued management and early detection of extrathymic malignancies may improve survival of patients with thymoma who are male, of advanced age, or have previous malignancies. Prospective studies are required to further investigate the management of extrathymic malignancies.","[Hamaji, Masatsugu; Date, Hiroshi] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Thorac Surg, Kyoto, Japan; [Sozu, Takashi] Tokyo Univ Sci, Fac Engn, Dept Informat & Comp Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Machida, Ryunosuke] Natl Canc Ctr, Ctr Res Adm & Support, Biostat Div, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Shun-Ichi] Natl Canc Ctr, Dept Thorac Surg, Tokyo, Japan; [Yoshida, Kazuo] Shinshu Univ, Dept Thorac Surg, Sch Med, Nagano, Japan; [Toyooka, Shinichi] Okayama Univ, Dept Thorac Breast & Endocrinol Surg, Grad Sch Med Dent & Pharmaceut Sci, Okayama, Japan; [Tanahashi, Masayuki] Seirei Mikatahara Gen Hosp, Resp Dis Ctr, Div Thorac Surg, Shizuoka, Japan; [Kondo, Kazuya] Tokushima Univ, Inst Biomed Sci, Dept Oncol Med Serv, Grad Sch, Tokushima, Japan; [Horio, Hirotoshi] Tokyo Metropolitan Canc & Infect Dis Ctr, Dept Thorac Surg, Komagome Hosp, Tokyo, Japan; [Okumura, Meinoshin] Natl Hosp Org Toneyama Hosp, Osaka, Japan","Hamaji, M (reprint author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Thorac Surg, Sakyo Ku, 54 Kawaharacho, Kyoto 6068507, Japan.",mhamaji@kuhp.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,18,0,0,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1569-9293,1569-9285,,INTERACT CARDIOV TH,Interact Cardiovasc.

The design of the oscillating microgels is based on the incorporation of neutral and hydrophilic acrylamide monomers into conventional microgels to suppress the irreversible aggregation of the microgels during oscillation at high substrate concentrations and high temperatures in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction. In contrast to conventional microgels, the aforementioned microgels can carry out the BZ reaction under optimized conditions without irreversible aggregation at higher temperature, resulting in short oscillation periods (similar to 7 s) that were obtained from optical transmittance measurements. Furthermore, a macrogel composed of organized microgels was prepared, which also showed a remarkably fast swelling/deswelling oscillation (oscillation period: similar to 23 s). This new type of oscillating microgel could be applied to advanced materials, e.g. to autonomously oscillating micropumps that imitate the human heartbeat.","[Matsui, Shusuke; Inui, Kohei; Kumai, Yuki; Suzuki, Daisuke] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Suzuki, Daisuke] Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Div Smart Text, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan; [Yoshida, Ryo] Univ Tokyo, Sch Engn, Dept Mat Engn, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1138656, Japan","Suzuki, D (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Text Sci & Technol, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.; Suzuki, D (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Inst Fiber Engn, Div Smart Text, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan.",d_suzuki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"; Suzuki, Daisuke/P-8171-2018","Matsui, Shusuke/0000-0003-3129-1755; Suzuki, Daisuke/0000-0003-0444-156X","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT) [26102517, 16H00760]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17J05706]; Japan Science Society [28-318];  [17H04892]","D.S. would like to acknowledge a Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (A) (17H04892) and Scientific Research on Innovative Areas from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT; 26102517 and 16H00760).

However, it is controversial whether EBS during steroid therapy is advisable, because the procedure itself carries a risk of cholangitis and procedure-related adverse events. This study aimed to clarify the validity and safety of EBS for patients with biliary stricture associated with IgG4-related pancreatobiliary disease (IgG4-PBD) during steroid therapy. Methods We enrolled 59 patients who presented with biliary stricture exhibiting jaundice or liver dysfunction and who were treated with EBS. The incidences of recurrent biliary obstruction and acute cholangitis were compared for EBS cases with and without steroid administration. Results EBS was present in 55 periods with steroid administration and 110 periods without. The incidence of recurrent biliary obstruction was significantly lower in cases with steroids than in those without (1-month no obstruction rate: 100 % vs. 82 %; log-rank test P = 0.0015). The incidence of acute cholangitis related to stenting was significantly lower in cases with steroids than in those without (1-month no acute cholangitis rate: 100 % vs. 90 %; log-rank test P = 0.0278). Biliary stents could be removed without acute cholangitis, liver dysfunction, or stent replacement in 96 % of patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography 1 month after commencing steroid administration. Conclusions EBS during steroid administration was both valid and safe in patients with biliary stricture associated with IgG4-PBD. Stents could be safely removed 1 month after steroid initiation.","[Kuraishi, Yasuhiro; Ashihara, Norihiro; Ozawa, Makiko; Nakamura, Akira; Watanabe, Takayuki; Ito, Tetsuya; Hamano, Hideaki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Gastroenterol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Muraki, Takashi] Azumi Hosp, North Alps Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 3207-1 Ikeda, Nagano 3998695, Japan; [Kawa, Shigeyuki] Matsumoto Dent Univ, Dept Internal Med, Shiojiri, Nagano, Japan","Muraki, T (reprint author), Azumi Hosp, North Alps Med Ctr, Dept Gastroenterol, 3207-1 Ikeda, Nagano 3998695, Japan.",murakitakashi1108@gmail.com,,,,,,35,0,1,0,0,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",2364-3722,2196-9736,,ENDOSC INT OPEN,Endosc.

This study aimed to identify the incidence and risk factors of the complications after OVC surgery. Methods: In this retrospective multicenter study, a total of 403 patients (314 women and 89 men; mean age 73.8 years) who underwent spinal fixation surgery for OVC with neurological deficits between 2005 and 2014 were enrolled. Data on patient demographics were collected, including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, steroid use, medical comorbidities, and surgical procedures. All postoperative complications that occurred within 6 weeks were recorded. Patients were classified into two groups, namely, complication group and no complication group, and risk factors for postoperative complications were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Postoperative complications occurred in 57 patients (14.1%), and the most common complication was delirium (5.7%). In the univariate analysis, the complication group was found to be older (p = 0.039) and predominantly male (p = 0.049), with higher occurrence rate of liver disease (p = 0.001) and Parkinson's disease (p = 0.039) compared with the no-complication group. In the multivariate analysis, the significant independent risk factors were age (p = 0.021; odds ratio [OR] 1.051, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007-1.097), liver disease (p < 0.001; OR 8.993, 95% CI 2.882-28.065), and Parkinson's disease (p = 0.009; OR 3.636, 95% CI 1.378-9.599). Conclusions: Complications after spinal fixation surgery for OVC with neurological deficits occurred in 14.1%. Age, liver disease, and Parkinson's disease were demonstrated to be independent risk factors for postoperative complications. (c) 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The study was conducted to investigate surgical outcomes for osteoporotic vertebral fracture (OVF) in the thoracolumbar spine. Methods: In total, 315 OVF patients (mean age, 74 years; 68 men and 247 women) with neurological symptoms who underwent spinal fusion with a minimum 2-year follow-up were included. The patients were divided into 5 groups by procedure: anterior spinal fusion alone (ASF group, n = 19), anterior/ posterior combined fusion (APSF group, n = 27), posterior spinal fusion alone (PSF group, n = 40), PSF with 3-column osteotomy (3CO group, n = 92), and PSF with vertebroplasty (VP + PSF group, n = 137). Results: Mean operation time was longer in the APSF group (p < 0.05), and intraoperative blood loss was lower in the VP + PSF group (p < 0.05). The amount of local kyphosis correction was greater in the APSF and 3CO groups (p < 0.05). Clinical outcomes were approximately equivalent among all groups. Conclusion: All 5 procedures resulted in acceptable neurological outcomes and functional improvement in walking ability.

In this study, we investigated the Lin7 family of scaffolding proteins, which interact with MPP6. By immunohistochemistry, Lin7a and Lin7c were localized in germ cells, and Lin7c had especially strong staining in spermatogonia and early spermatocytes, characterized by staging of seminiferous tubules. By immunoelectron microscopy, Lin7 localization appeared under cell membranes in germ cells. The Lin7 staining pattern in seminiferous tubules was partially similar to that of 4.1G, cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), and melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM). Lin7-positive cells included type A spermatogonia, as revealed by double staining for Lin28a. Lin7 staining became weaker in MPP6-deficient mice by immunohistochemistry and western blotting, indicating that MPP6 transports and maintains Lin7 in germ cells. The histology of seminiferous tubules was unchanged in MPP6-deficient mice compared to that of wild-type mice. In cultured spermatogonial stem cells maintained with glial cell line-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF), Lin7 was clearly expressed and immunolocalized along cell membranes, especially at cell-cell junctions. Thus, Lin7 protein is expressed in germ cells, and Lin7, particularly Lin7c, is a useful marker for early spermatogenesis.","[Kamijo, Akio; Saitoh, Yurika; Terada, Nobuo] Shinshu Univ, Div Hlth Sci, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Saitoh, Yurika] Teikyo Univ Sci, Ctr Med Educ, Adachi Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Sakamoto, Takeharu] Univ Tokyo, Inst Med Sci, Div Cellular & Mol Biol, Minato Ku, Tokyo, Japan; [Kubota, Hiroshi] Kitasato Univ, Sch Vet Med, Dept Anim Sci, Lab Cell & Mol Biol, Towada, Aomori, Japan; [Yamauchi, Junji] Tokyo Univ Pharm & Life Sci, Sch Life Sci, Lab Mol Neurosci & Neurol, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan","Terada, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Div Hlth Sci, Dept Med Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",nobuot@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,"Sakamoto, Takeharu/0000-0002-1225-1902",,,,47,0,0,1,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0948-6143,1432-119X,,HISTOCHEM CELL BIOL,Histochem.

A density functional theory method is used to calculate isolated, SnO2- and graphene-supported Pt-nanoparticles. Work function difference between the Pt-nanoparticles and SnO2 leads to electron donation from the nanoparticles to the support, making the outer-shell atoms of the supported nanoparticles more positively charged compared to unsupported nanoparticles. From an electrostatic point of view, nucleophilic species tend to interact more stably with less negatively charged Pt atoms blocking the active sites for the reaction to occur, which can explain the low activity of Pt-nanoparticles supported on SnO2. Introducing oxygen vacancies and Nb dopants on SnO2 decreases the support work function, which not only reduces the charge transferred from the Pt-nanoparticles to the support but also reverses the direction of the electrons flow making the surface Pt atoms more negatively charged. A similar effect is observed when using graphene, which has a lower work function than Pt. Thus, the blocking of the active sites by nucleophilic species decreases, hence increasing the activity. These results provide a clue to improve the activity by modifying the support work function and by selecting a support material with an appropriate work function to control the charge of the nanoparticle's surface atoms.

Plasma-replaced PC suspended in bicarbonate Ringer's solution and anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution A (RPC-B) is effective for preventing ATRs in children in Japan; however, there is not enough evidence in adult populations. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis focused on factors associated with ATRs developing from PC transfusions in adult patients in a single institution between 2015 and 2018. The clinical efficacy of RPC-B for adult patients was also analyzed. RESULTS In total, 4,677 untreated regular PC products in plasma were transfused into 914 patients. ATRs developed in 65 patients (7.1%) treated with 92 PC products (2.0%). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who were elderly, diagnosed with a non-hematological disease, and who received a transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma and red blood cell concentrate products together with PC products had lower frequencies of ATRs. Although 40 patients received 490 RPC-B transfusions, six ATRs (1.2%) were confirmed in five patients (12.5%). The ATR frequency was not significantly lower in the analysis of all patients; however, ATRs in patients with hematological diseases were lower in terms of both the patient and product numbers. Corrected count increments (24 hr) were also within an acceptable range in patients with hematological diseases. CONCLUSION Several patient-specific factors may be associated with the development of ATRs from PC transfusion. Because RPC-B appears to efficiently prevent ATRs, even in adult patients, safe and efficient transfusions may be performed by using RPC-B preferentially depending on the patient's risk factors.","[Yamanaka, Manjiro; Yanagisawa, Ryu; Kojima, Shunsuke] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Div Blood Transfus, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Yanagisawa, Ryu; Kojima, Shunsuke] Shinshu Univ, Shinshu Univ Hosp, Sch Med, Ctr Adv Cell Therapy, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Nakazawa, Hideyuki] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Hematol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Shimodaira, Shigetaka] Kanazawa Med Univ, Dept Regenerat Med, Uchinada, Ishikawa, Japan","Yanagisawa, R (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Div Blood Transfus, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",ryu@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,35,0,0,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0041-1132,1537-2995,,TRANSFUSION,Transfusion,NOV,2019,59,11,,,,,3405,3412,,10.1111/trf.15527,,,8,Hematology,Hematology,JK2OO,WOS:000494686500019,31532542,,,,2020/4/20

We observed a novel pattern that we termed a filigree MIP pattern and investigated its relationship with the classical MIP pattern. Methods: Filigree pattern was defined as tumor cells growing in delicate, lace-like, narrow stacks of cells without fibrovascular cores. We required at least three piled-up nuclei from the alveolar wall basal layer, with a breadth of up to three cells across. To assess the relationship of the filigree pattern with the classical MIP pattern, we documented their frequencies in the context of the clinical and pathologic characteristics of 1468 stage I invasive adenocarcinomas, including survival analysis using cumulative incidence of recurrence by competing risks. Results: We observed the filigree MIP pattern in 35% of cases. By including the filigree pattern as an MIP pattern, we identified 57 more MIP predominant cases in addition to the previously diagnosed 87 MIP predominant adenocarcinomas. These 57 cases were reclassified from papillary (n = 37), acinar (n = 16), and solid (n = 4) predominant adenocarcinoma, respectively. Of the 144 MIP predominant adenocarcinomas, the filigree predominant MIP pattern (n = 78) showed a poor prognosis like the classical predominant MIP pattern (n = 66) (p = 0.464). In addition, like the classical MIP pattern (p = 0.010), even a small amount (>= 5%) of filigree MIP pattern was significantly associated with worse cumulative incidence of recurrence (p = 0.001) in multivariable analysis. Conclusion: The frequent association with the classical MIP pattern and the similar poor prognosis supports inclusion of the filigree pattern in the MIP pattern subtype.

The samples were characterized with SEM, XRD, FESEM, EDX, XPS, TEM, FTIR analysis and antibacterial assays. Synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed by XRD, XPS and TEM analysis. The TEM images demonstrated CNAgNP samples well decorated with AgNPs. Sizes of the spherical AgNPs, calculated by Debye-Scherrer method, were 20 nm. Antibacterial test results confirmed excellent bacterial growth inhibition properties of CNAgNP on agar plates and in liquid medium against E. coli and S. aureus strains. The relative cell viability (CFU/mL) test results demonstrated excellent bactericidal potential of the CNAgNP samples against the tested strains.

Since gastrointestinal cancers account for more than 40% of all cancer-related deaths, it is imperative to formulate effective strategies to control them. Materials and methods, and results Basic drug discovery research Our research has revealed that the abnormal expression of regulators of chromosomal stability is a cause of cancers and identified an effective compound against cancers with chromosomal instability. We revealed the molecular mechanism of peritoneal dissemination of cancer cells via the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis to CAR-like cells and identified an MEK inhibitor effective against these tumors. Residual tumor cells after chemotherapy in colorectal cancer are LGR5-positive cancer stem cells and their ability to eliminate reactive oxygen species is elevated. The development of surgical procedures and devices In cases of gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer, we determined the anastomotic line for evaluating the blood flow using ICG angiography and measuring the tissue O2 metabolism. We established a novel gastric reconstruction method (book-binding technique) for gastric cancer and a new rectal reconstruction method focusing on the intra-intestinal pressure resistance for rectal cancer. We established a novel tissue fusion method, which allows contact-free local heating and retains tissue viability with very little damage, and developed an understanding of the collagen-related processes that underpin laser-induced tissue fusion. Strategy to prevent carcinogenesis We succeeded in cleaving hepatitis B virus DNA integrated into the nucleus of hepatocytes using genome editing tools. The development of HCC from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may be prevented by metabolic surgery. Conclusion We believe that these efforts will help to significantly improve the gastrointestinal cancer treatment and survival.","[Maehara, Yoshihiko] Mutual Aid Assoc Publ Sch Teachers, Kyushu Cent Hosp, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Soejima, Yuji; Yoshizumi, Tomoharu; Kawahara, Naoyuki; Oki, Eiji; Saeki, Hiroshi; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Ikegami, Toru; Yamashita, Yo-ichi; Furuyama, Tadashi; Sugimachi, Keishi; Harada, Noboru; Tagawa, Tetsuzo; Harimoto, Norifumi; Itoh, Shinji; Sonoda, Hideto; Ando, Koji; Nakashima, Yuichiro; Nagao, Yoshihiro; Yamashita, Nami; Kasagi, Yuta; Yukaya, Takafumi; Kurihara, Takeshi; Tsutsumi, Ryosuke; Takamori, Shinkichi; Sasaki, Shun; Mori, Masaki] Kyushu Univ, Dept Surg & Sci, Grad Sch Med Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Soejima, Yuji] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Saeki, Hiroshi; Harimoto, Norifumi] Gunma Univ, Dept Gen Surg Sci, Grad Sch Med, Gunma, Japan; [Akahoshi, Tomohiko] Kyushu Univ, Dept Adv Med Initiat, Grad Sch Med Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yamashita, Yo-ichi] Kumamoto Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci, Dept Surg Gastroenterol, Kumamoto, Japan; [Sugimachi, Keishi] Natl Hosp Org Kyushu Canc Ctr, Dept Hepatobiliary Pancreat Surg, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Sonoda, Hideto] Imari Arita Kyoritsu Hosp, Dept Surg, Saga, Japan; [Kasagi, Yuta] Fukuoka Higashi Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yukaya, Takafumi] Iizuka Hosp, Dept Surg, Iizuka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Ikeda, Tetsuo] Fukuoka Dent Coll, Endoscopy & Endoscop Surg, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yonemitsu, Yoshikazu; Teraishi, Koji] Kyushu Univ, R&D Lab Innovat Biotherapeut, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Fukuhara, Takasuke] Osaka Univ, Microbial Dis Res Inst, Dept Mol Virol, Osaka, Japan; [Kitao, Hiroyuki; Iimori, Makoto; Kataoka, Yuki; Wakasa, Takeshi] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Dept Mol Canc Biol, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Kataoka, Yuki; Wakasa, Takeshi] Taiho Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan; [Suzuki, Masami] Chugai Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan; [Teraishi, Koji] Ono Pharmaceut Co Ltd, Osaka, Japan; [Yoshida, Yasuto] Yakult Cent Inst, Tokyo, Japan","Maehara, Y (reprint author), Mutual Aid Assoc Publ Sch Teachers, Kyushu Cent Hosp, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan.",maehara@kyushu-ctr-hsp.com,"Harimoto, Norifumi/AAF-6070-2020","Ando, Koji/0000-0002-0149-1505","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and TechnologyMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT); Ministry of Health, Labour and WelfareMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan; Japan Agency for Medical Research and DevelopmentJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED)","Twenty seven of our studies have been financially supported by these agencies.

However, there is concern regarding insufficient resection of odontoid and surgical complications, including vessel injuries, because this is a historically immature procedure. Here, we report a surgical case of endoscopic endonasal odontoidectomy (EEO) in the hybrid operating room (hOR) for improvement of its safety and reliability. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of myelopathic gait disturbance and swallowing disturbance. Neuroimaging analysis indicated medulla oblongata compression associated with basilar invagination. The patient underwent EEO in the hOR after posterior instrumented fixation. With the hOR, the extent of bone resection and anatomic orientation were confirmed intraoperatively. Postoperative course was uneventful, and symptoms were improved after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The application of the hOR may make the EEO safe and precise for anterior decompression of the CVJ. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing clinical experience of EEO in the hOR.","[Ogiwara, Toshihiro; Miyaoka, Yoshinari; Nakamura, Takuya; Yamazaki, Daisuke; Ito, Kiyoshi; Hanaoka, Yoshiki; Koyama, Jun-Ichi; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro] Shinshu Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Tsukada, Keita] Shinshu Univ, Dept Otorhinolaryngol, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Ogiwara, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Neurosurg, Sch Med, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",togiwara@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,10,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1878-8750,1878-8769,,WORLD NEUROSURG,World Neurosurg.,NOV,2019,131,,,,,,137,140,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.197,,,4,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,JG3GV,WOS:000491963300107,31382069,,,,2020/4/20

However, this technique can he anatomically challenging in the type I aortic arch. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have reported on neurointervention using a Simmonds guiding sheath and the left transradial approach. We devised a novel technique using the contralateral subclavian artery as an ""anchor"" to reform the Simmonds curve, named the subclavian artery anchoring technique (SCAT). The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and usefulness of neurointervention with the SCAT for patients with a type I aortic arch treated with the right transradial approach and patients treated with the left transradial approach. METHODS: Ten consecutive patients treated from June 2018 to January 2019 were included in the present study. We retrospectively analyzed: 1) the success rate for reforming the Simmonds curve using the SCAT; 2) the success rate for introducing the 6F Simmonds guiding sheath into the target common carotid artery; 3) the success rate for completing the procedure; 4) periprocedural complications; and 5) vascular access site complications. RESULTS: In all 10 patients, the Simmonds curve was reformed, and a 6F Simmonds guiding sheath was introduced into the target common carotid artery. The procedure was successfully achieved for all 10 patients without periprocedural or vascular access site complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have shown that this technique is a feasible, safe, and useful method for patients with type I aortic arch treated with a right transradial approach or a left transradial approach. SCAT makes up for a deficiency in the transradial approach with a 6F Simmonds guiding sheath.","[Hanaoka, Yoshiki; Ogiwara, Toshihiro; Miyaoka, Yoshinari; Fujii, Yu; Nakamura, Takuya; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Koyama, Jun-ichi] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Neurointervent Ctr, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Horiuchi, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",tetuyosi@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,23,0,0,0,0,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1878-8750,1878-8769,,WORLD NEUROSURG,World Neurosurg.,NOV,2019,131,,,,,,E362,E370,,10.1016/j.wneu.2019.07.162,,,9,Clinical Neurology; Surgery,Neurosciences & Neurology; Surgery,JG3GV,WOS:000491963300044,31362101,,,,2020/4/20

In the work, solid solutions of zinc selenide and copper gallium selenide with absorption edge wavelengths ranging from 480 to 730 nm were developed. Using these metal selenides as H-2-evolving photocatalysts, CoOx/BiVO4 as the O-2-evolving photocatalyst, and reduced graphene oxide as the electron mediator, all-solid-state Z-scheme overall pure water splitting systems were constructed. The rate of photocatalytic H-2 evolution from aqueous solutions containing Na2S and Na2SO3 as the electron donors was evaluated while employing these selenide photocatalysts at various Zn/(Zn+Cu) and Ga/Cu molar ratios. The data demonstrate that efficient Z-scheme overall water splitting was significantly correlated to the photoelectrochemical performance of the selenide photocatalysts acting as photocathodes, rather than the photocatalytic activities of these materials during the sacrificial H-2 evolution.

Here, we explore whether the source of synaptic inputs to the motor neurons (cats) and the age or post-stroke conditions (humans) may change the recruitment gain of the motor neuron pool. In cats, the size of Ia EPSPs in triceps surae motor neurons (input) and monosynaptic reflexes (MSRs; output) was recorded in the soleus and medial gastrocnemius motor nerves following graded stimulation of dorsal roots. The MSR was plotted against the EPSP thereby obtaining a measure of the recruitment gain. Conditioning stimulation of sural and peroneal cutaneous afferents caused significant increase in the recruitment gain of the medial gastrocnemius, but not the soleus motor neuron pool. In humans, the discharge probability of individual soleus motor units (input) and soleus H-reflexes (output) was performed. With graded stimulation of the tibial nerve, the gain of the motor neuron pool was assessed as the slope of the relation between probability of firing and the reflex size. The gain in young subjects was higher than in elderly subjects. The gain in post-stroke survivors was higher than in age-matched neurologically intact subjects. These findings provide experimental evidence that recruitment gain of a motor neuron pool contributes to the regulation of movement at the final output stage from the spinal cord and should be considered when interpreting changes in reflex excitability in relation to movement or injuries of the nervous system.","[Nielsen, J.

One of the hygienic face mask's performance requirements is a close fit between the mask sheet and the wearer's facial contours. The present study proposed an optimal shape and size for a mask sheet pattern that provides a sheet with high fit performance for a large number of people. The study experiments analyzed a variety of patterns: i.e. three types of two-dimensional (2D) pattern (i.e. second, third or fourth rings) were used to expand the face mask area to cover the wearers' nose and mouth (first ring), and were analyzed based on three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of participants' facial contours (n = 132) with closed mouths. Subsequently, the analyzed patterns were used to make prototype mask sheets from nonwoven fabric. The fit performances of the face mask sheets were tested using a 3D analyzer. It was difficult to provide high fit performance at all measurement points; therefore, a range of 3 SD in the analyzed pattern was calculated with the aim of fitting more people with 100% precision. The results showed that a number of wearers, i.e. 91.7% (second ring), 93.2% (third ring) and 90.2% (fourth ring), had 100% precision. Moreover, the second ring pattern had the smallest 3 SD amount. These results show that the shape and size of the second ring pattern was most appropriate for young Japanese people with closed mouths.","[Morishima, Mika] Kanazawa Univ, Inst Human & Social Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan; [Mitsuno, Tamaki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Educ, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Morishima, M (reprint author), Kanazawa Univ, Inst Human & Social Sci, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 9201192, Japan.",morishimam@staff.kanazawa-u.ac.jp,,,,,,39,0,0,13,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0040-5175,1746-7748,,TEXT RES J,Text.

Here we describe thermally and mechanically stable near-ultraviolet (near-UV) transparent and conducting films on ultrathin flexible glass produced from Zn/Al complex-SWCNT inks by bar coating. Our SWCNT/glass TCF is flexible and its relative resistance remains almost constant with increasing bending angle up to similar to 170 degrees. Sheet resistance decreases from 80 Omega/sq to 68 Omega/sq after heating in vacuum and increases from 80 Omega/sq to 300 Omega/sq after heating in air from 300 to 523 K. Transmittance in the near-UV region is in the range of 80-90% and does not change with increasing temperature up to 523 K.

The lower volume expansion rate of Sn-86 than pure Sn anode can be confirmed by in-operando investigation using an optically transparent cell during the 1st charging process. This is attribute to the co-deposited Ni can act as a buffer matrix to restrain volume expansion. For the full-cell test, the pre-lithiation condition of Sn-Ni was investigated with different depth of discharge levels. As a result, a LIC consisting of activated carbon (AC) cathode and Sn-86 exhibits a good cyclability for 3000 cycles with a capacity retention of 80% and coulombic efficiency of 98% at 3000th cycle.

Clinical trials testing AR-targeting therapies in breast cancer have been conducted. Assessment of AR-signal in breast cancer tissue maybe useful for treatment selections. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the product of an androgen-responsive gene. Serum PSA (sPSA) can be detected in women by a highly sensitive assay although the concentration is much lower than that observed in males. We investigated if sPSA reflects tumor biology, including AR signaling in breast cancer patients. Methods: In this study, 132 healthy controls and 144 breast cancer patients were enrolled. sPSA was evaluated by the chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) method. Correlations between sPSA and the various clinicopathological factors were analyzed. Results: In post-menopausal state, sPSA detection rate was significantly higher in breast cancer patients compared with controls (27.4% vs 11.3%: p = 0.0090), but not in the whole cohort (29.2% vs 25.8%: p = 0.5265) or pre-menopausal subgroup (37.0% vs 42.6%: p = 0.6231). In post-menopausal breast cancer cases, higher sPSA value was associated with clinic-pathological factors including the expression of AR protein in primary legion. In a correlation analysis of quantitative data limited to post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer (MBC), sPSA was positively, albeit weakly correlated with clinic-pathological features including serum testosterone levels and AR positivity. Conclusions: Our data suggest that sPSA may reflect tumor biological properties including AR activity in postmenopausal breast cancer.","[Hanamura, Toru; Ohno, Koichi] Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Dept Breast & Endocrine Surg, 5-11-50 Kogan Dori, Suwa, Nagano 3928510, Japan; [Hanamura, Toru; Ohno, Koichi; Ito, Ken-ichi] Shinshu Univ, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, Dept Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Hanamura, Toru] Univ Colorado Anschutz Med Campus, Dept Pathol, 12800 East 19th Ave, Aurora, CO 80045 USA; [Hokibara, Shinya; Nakamura, Toshitsugu] Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Dept Diagnost Pathol, 5-11-50 Kogan Dori, Suwa, Nagano 3928510, Japan; [Murasawa, Hideki] Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Dept Lab Med, 5-11-50 Kogan Dori, Suwa, Nagano 3928510, Japan; [Watanabe, Hidehiko] Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Med Checkup Ctr, 5-11-50 Kogan Dori, Suwa, Nagano 3928510, Japan; [Kaizuka, Machiko] Suwa Cent Hosp, Dept Surg, 4300 Tamagawa, Chino, Nagano 3918503, Japan; [Sawano, Shinji] Okaya City Hosp, Dept Surg, 4-11-33 Hon Machi, Okaya, Nagano 3948512, Japan; [Koyama, Hiroshi] Koyama Breast & Thyroid Clin, 1-2557-1 Jonan, Suwa, Nagano 3920017, Japan","Hanamura, T (reprint author), Suwa Red Cross Hosp, Dept Breast & Endocrine Surg, 5-11-50 Kogan Dori, Suwa, Nagano 3928510, Japan.; Hanamura, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Div Breast & Endocrine Surg, Dept Surg, Sch Med, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",hanamuratooru@hotmail.co.jp,"Hanamura, Toru/AAE-5184-2020","Hanamura, Toru/0000-0002-6934-8588",,,,45,0,0,1,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2407,,BMC CANCER,BMC Cancer,29-Oct,2019,19,1,,,,,,,1021,10.1186/s12885-019-6256-2,,,11,Oncology,Oncology,JR5UA,WOS:000499688600009,31664946,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

However, previous research has not used this for fresh fine root systems of tree species. We aimed to explore the predictive ability of spectral reflectance relationships among fine-root morphological, anatomical, and chemical traits for 12 tree species in a temperate forest in Japan. Methods Intact fresh systems of fine root were imaged at 478-978 nm wavelengths (153 bands, 3.6 nm interval). Relationships between spectral reflectance and specific root length, root tissue density, branching intensity, stele/cortex ratio, and Ca concentration were analyzed at each spectral band. Results Reflectance peaked at around 920 nm across all species; however, reflectance magnitude at spectral regions of blue (478 nm), green (546 nm), red (648 nm), and near-infrared (847 nm) significantly differed among species. All variables measuring traits were significantly correlated with spectral reflectance only at specific wavelengths, but the strength of the correlation differed among wavelengths. Conclusion Spectral reflectance in visible-near-infrared regions for fresh intact root systems can evaluate the species-differences in fine root traits, and can predict fine root traits across species. Our findings facilitate a general assessment of root traits across tree species and will allow more accurate estimation of fine root functions.","[Tanikawa, Natsuko; Yahara, Hikari; Makita, Naoki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Nakaji, Tatsuro] Hokkaido Univ, Uryu Expt Forest, Moshiri, Hokkaido 0740741, Japan","Makita, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",macky@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Fujiwara Natural History Foundation [15 K18719, 18 K14488, 16H04929]","The authors acknowledged Ms. H Umezu, Ms. K Nakazawa, Ms. JWang, Dr. H Kobayashi Dr. T Kunito and Dr. H Park of Shinshu University for helpful support in field and laboratory experiments.

In the present study, the effect of wing mass on the free flight of butterflies is investigated by numerical simulations based on an immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method. We use a butterfly-like model consisting of two square wings with mass connected by a rod-shaped body. We simulate the free flights of the model by changing the ratio of the wing mass to the total mass of the model and also changing the mass distributions of the wings. As a result, we find that the aerodynamic vertical and horizontal forces decrease as the wing-mass ratio increases, since for a large wing-mass ratio the body has large vertical and horizontal oscillations in each stroke and consequently the speeds of the wing tip and the leading edge relatively decrease. In addition, we find that the wing-mass ratio has a dominant effect on the rotational motion of the model, and a large wing-mass ratio reduces aerodynamic force and intensifies the time variation of the pitching angle. From the results of our free flight simulations, we clarify the critical wing-mass ratio between upward flight and downward flight and find that the critical wing-mass ratio is a function of the non-dimensional total mass and almost independent of the wing length. Then, we evaluate the effect of the wing-mass distribution on the critical wing-mass ratio. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the model.","[Suzuki, K.; Yoshino, M.] Shinshu Univ, Acad Assembly, Inst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Okada, I] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Yoshino, M.] Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, Interdisciplinary Cluster Cutting Edge Res, Nagano 3808553, Japan","Suzuki, K (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Acad Assembly, Inst Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan.",kosuzuki@shinshu-u.ac.jp,"Suzuki, Kosuke/M-9266-2017","Suzuki, Kosuke/0000-0001-9034-4082","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP16K18012]",This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI grant number JP16K18012.

Consequently, D. galeata has rarely appeared in Lake Suwa since summer 2017, except for a low-density population observed in May-June 2018. These phenomena indicated that fish predation is a possible primary factor for suppressing daphnid populations in shallow eutrophic lake. Zooplankton populations showed species-specific responses to the alterations in predation pressure. When the D. galeata population peaked after the fish kill event, rotifers, which are small-sized competitors of daphnids, and calanoids tended to decrease in density. Rotifers then increased with the decrease in the daphnid populations due to the recovery of fish. Alternatively, cyclopoids, which demonstrated a similar population density following the fish kill event, tended to decrease when the fish population recovered. The population densities of Leptodora cf. kindtii/richardi and Bosmina spp. did not significantly differ between before the massive kill event and after pond smelt recovery. It is believed that the changes in zooplankton population densities observed in the present study may provide insights for further monitoring of aquatic food webs in eutrophic water systems, including Lake Suwa, where re-oligotrophication is occurring and biological interactions are changing.","[Oh, Hye-Ji; Chang, Kwang-Hyeon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Yongin, South Korea; [Oda, Yusuke; Hanazato, Takayuki; Miyabara, Yuichi] Shinshu Univ, Inst Mt Sci, Suwa, Japan; [Ha, Jin-Yong] Environm Informat Commun Co Ltd, Matsumoto Res Ctr, Nagano, Japan; [Nagata, Takamaru] Lake Biwa Environm Res Inst, Otsu, Shiga, Japan; [Sakamoto, Masaki] Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama, Japan; [Ha, Jin-Yong] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Mt & Environm Sci, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Sakamoto, M (reprint author), Toyama Prefectural Univ, Dept Environm & Civil Engn, 5180 Kurokawa, Imizu, Toyama, Japan.; Oh, HJ; Chang, KH (reprint author), Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, 1732 Deogyeong Daero, Yongin, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ohg2090@naver.com; masaki@pu-toyama.ac.jp; chang38@khu.ac.kr,,"Oh, Hye-Ji/0000-0003-2098-8485","JSPS KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [JP17K00584]","JSPS KAKENHI for Scientific Research (C), Grant/Award Number: JP17K00584",,34,0,0,6,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0912-3814,1440-1703,,ECOL RES,Ecol.

Polymer composites from polylactide (PLA) and MFC were prepared using two different fiber preparations. Freezedried MFC was prepared and directly mixed with PLA in an internal mixer. The MFC premixed with PLA in an organic solvent was prepared, followed by an internal mixer for another composite. In addition, grafting cellulose on PLA using a compatibilizer was performed. In this research, composites containing 10 wt% MFC were used to investigate the influence of processing and compatibilizer on the mechanical and thermal properties. The processing procedure had a great influence on the mechanical and physical properties. The tensile strength was increased with filler loading and showed different values depending on the premixing step prior to processing. The storage modulus and loss tangent confirmed that the compatibilizer acted as the role of a bridge between filler and matrix, enhancing the mechanical properties. This experiment was conducted to compare the effect of pretreatment on the change of mechanical and thermal properties by using freeze-dried cellulose and cellulose suspension substituted with an organic solvent.","[Lee, Hyo Jae; Ryu, Yeon Sung; Kim, Seong Hun] Hanyang Univ, Dept Organ & Nano Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea; [Kim, Ick Soo] Shinshu Univ, Nano Fus Technol Res Lab, Div Frontier Fibers, Inst Fiber Engn IFES,ICCER, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868567, Japan","Kim, SH (reprint author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Organ & Nano Engn, 222 Wangsimni Ro, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",kimsh@hanyang.ac.kr,"Kim, Ick Soo/N-1568-2015",,"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education [NRF-2015R1D1A1A01059583, NRF-2016R1A6A1A03013422]","This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (NRF-2015R1D1A1A01059583, NRF-2016R1A6A1A03013422).",,24,1,1,2,2,POLYMER SOC KOREA,SEOUL,"ROOM 601, HATCHON BUILDING, 831 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-KU, SEOUL 135-792, SOUTH KOREA",1598-5032,2092-7673,,MACROMOL RES,Macromol.

Hospitalized patients with IP have severely impaired pulmonary diffusion capacity and prominent desaturation. We hypothesized that determining oxygen saturation recovery (SpO(2) recovery index) after the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) can provide additional prognostic information regarding rehospitalization for respiratory-related events. We evaluated 73 IP patients at our hospital for demographic characteristics, pulmonary function tests and 6MWT. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate rehospitalisation for respiratory-related events using SpO(2) recovery index. Cox regression analysis revealed a relationship between SpO(2) recovery index and rehospitalisation. The optimum cutoff value of SpO(2) recovery index was 4% (sensitivity, 71.4%; specificity, 79.2%). SpO(2) recovery index was most closely related to pulmonary diffusion capacity (r = 0.684, P < 0.001). In a multivariable model, it was the strongest independent predictor of rehospitalisation for respiratory-related events (hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.90; P = 0.032). In this study, we estimated pulmonary diffusion capacity using SpO(2) recovery index values obtained from 6MWT. A SpO(2) recovery index of <4% can be useful in predicting rehospitalisation for respiratory-related events.","[Sakai, Yasunari; Yamamoto, Shuhei; Hoshina, Miho; Kawachi, Shohei] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Rehabil, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Ichiyama, Takashi; Hanaoka, Masayuki] Shinshu Univ Hosp, Resp Ctr, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan","Sakai, Y (reprint author), Shinshu Univ Hosp, Rehabil, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.",yasunari_sakai1028@yahoo.co.jp,,,,,,30,0,0,0,0,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,23-Oct,2019,9,,,,,,,,15226,10.1038/s41598-019-51818-1,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JG1TJ,WOS:000491859500016,31645644,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2020/4/20

In order to prevent such devastating complication, intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP) has been conducted. However, to prevent postoperative motor dysfunction, proper understanding of MEP monitoring and proper anesthetic managements are required. Especially, a variety of anesthetics and neuromuscular blocking agent are known to attenuate MEP responses. In addition to the selection of anesthetic regime to record the baseline and control MEP, the measures to keep the level of hypnosis and muscular relaxation at constant are crucial to detect the changes of MEP responses after the surgical manipulation. Once the changes of MEP are observed based on the institutional alarm criteria, multidisciplinary team members should share the results of MEP monitoring and respond to check the status of monitoring and recover the possible motor nerve injury. Prevention of MEP-related adverse effects is also important to be considered. The Working Group of Japanese Society of Anesthesiologists (JSA) developed this practical guide aimed to help ensure safe and successful surgery through appropriate anesthetic management during intraoperative MEP monitoring.","[Kawaguchi, Masahiko; Hayashi, Hironobu] Nara Med Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Kashihara, Nara, Japan; [Iida, Hiroki] Gifu Univ, Grad Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Gifu, Japan; [Tanaka, Satoshi] Shinshu Univ, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol & Resuscitol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Fukuoka, Naokazu] Gifu Univ Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Gifu, Japan; [Izumi, Shunsuke; Kakinohana, Manabu] Univ Ryukyus, Fac Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan; [Yoshitani, Kenji] Natl Cerebral & Cardiovasc Ctr, Dept Anesthesiol, Suita, Osaka, Japan","Kawaguchi, M (reprint author), Nara Med Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.",drjkawa@naramed-u.ac.jp,,,JSA,The creation of this guide was funded by the JSA.

In contrast, because the earliest divergent lineage of extant land plants, i.e. Haplomitriopsida liverworts, associates only with Mucoromycotina mycobionts, recent studies suggested that those fungi are novel candidates for the earliest mycobionts. Therefore, Mucoromycotina-Haplomitriopsida association currently attracts attention as an ancient mycorrhiza-like association. However, mycobionts were identified in only 7 of 16 Haplomitriopsida species and the mycobionts diversity of this lineage is largely unclarified. To clarify the taxonomic composition of mycobionts in Haplomitriopsida, we observed MLSs in the rhizome of Haplomitrium mnioides (Haplomitriopsida), the Asian representative Haplomitriopsida species, and conducted molecular identification of mycobionts. It was recorded for the first time that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina co-occur in Haplomitriopsida as mycobionts. Significantly, the arbuscule-like branching (ALB) of Glomeromycotina was newly described. As the Mucoromycotina fungi forming MLSs in H. mnioides, Endogonaceae and Densosporaceae were detected, in which size differences of hyphal swelling (HS) were found between the fungal families. This study provides a novel evidence in the MLS of Haplomitriopsida, i.e. the existence of Glomeromycotina association as well as the dominant Mucoromycotina association. In addition, since hyphal characteristics of the HS-type MLS were quite similar to those of fine endophytes (FE) of Endogonales in other bryophytes and vascular plants previously described, this MLS is suggested to be included in FE. These results suggest that Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina were acquired concurrently as the mycobionts by the earliest land plants evolved into arbuscular mycorrhizae and FE. Therefore, dual association of Haplomitriopsida, with Endogonales and Glomeromycotina will provide us novel insight on how the earliest land plants adapted to terrestrial habitats with fungi.","[Yamamoto, Kohei; Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci & Food Prod Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Shimamura, Masaki] Hiroshima Univ, Dept Biol, Grad Sch Sci, Higashihiroshima, Hiroshima 7398526, Japan; [Degawa, Yousuke] Univ Tsukuba, Mt Sci Ctr, Sugadaira Res Stn, 1278-294 Sugadaira, Ueda, Nagano 3862204, Japan; [Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Res Ctr Fungal & Microbial Dynamism, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan; [Yamada, Akiyoshi] Shinshu Univ, Div Terr Ecosyst, Inst Mt Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan","Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Dept Biosci & Food Prod Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Agr, Dept Biosci & Biotechnol, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Res Ctr Fungal & Microbial Dynamism, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.; Yamada, A (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Div Terr Ecosyst, Inst Mt Sci, 8304 Minami Minowa, Nagano 3994598, Japan.",akiyosh@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP14J09199, JP25291084, JP15H01751]","We are grateful to Prof. Mitsuru Moriguchi, Dr. Takamichi Orihara, Ms. Yumiko Oba, Mr. Yoshiteru Kawabata, and Dr. Kanami Yoshino for supporting for our sampling.

A wide variation in the degree of chemical weathering, source rock compositions and grain sizes was observed with vertical and spatial changes in the sedimentary environment. Coarse-grained sediments, deposited in sandy channels and their floodplains, indicate a lower but wide range of CIA values. This result suggests that the degree of chemical weathering can be modified by changes in grain size due to hydrologic processes. In contrast, stagnant water sediments, composed of homogeneous fine-grained sediments, display a wide variety of REE compositions and Al2O3/SiO2 ratios mainly caused by variation in source rock compositions and grain sizes. However, the CIA values of the stagnant water sediments are over 90, such that these sediments display a tight cluster near the Al2O3 apex on the Al2O3-(CaO + Na2O)-K2O ternary diagram. This study demonstrates CIA values are generally above 90, which is due to the increased leaching of Ca, Na, and K with exposure to under intense chemical weathering conditions even if the source rocks and grain sizes are variable. Regardless of the wide variety of source rock compositions and grain sizes, REE and kaolinite-rich clay mineral concentrations in these sediments are indicative of the intense weathering conditions that prevailed in the Pliocene period (3-4 Ma) in southwest Japan.","[Hatano, Nozomi] Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Yoshida, Kohki] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Adachi, Yoshiko] Niigata Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geol, Niigata, Japan; [Sasao, Eiji] Japan Atom Energy Agcy, Tokai, Ibaraki, Japan; [Adachi, Yoshiko] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Sci, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan","Hatano, N (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Interdisciplinary Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",hatano.n6@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for Promotions of ScienceMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [17K05678]; METI (Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry)","We thank Mr. M.

Zircons from all sites (six sites) yielded mainly Precambrian and Permian-Jurassic ages. The Precambrian zircons were derived from the North China Block, whereas the Permian-Jurassic zircons were derived from igneous rocks in and around the Korean Peninsula. The percentage of Precambrian zircons ranged from 39.9% to 52.9% (average 45.5%) of the total, and that of the Permian-Jurassic zircons ranged from 46.5% to 57.6 (average 52.6%). Thus, during the Jurassic, an equal number of zircons was continuously supplied from in and around the Korean Peninsula and the North China Block into a trench on the eastern margin of the Asian continent. The percentage of Permian and Triassic zircons gradually decreased over time, whereas the percentage of Jurassic zircons gradually increased. These changes likely reflected the igneous activity in and around the Korean Peninsula during the Jurassic. These results indicate that the turbidite sandstones of the Jurassic accretionary complex in Southwest Japan comprise detritus from not only the North China Block but also the igneous activity in and around the Korean Peninsula. Therefore, the Jurassic accretionary complex in Southwest Japan was likely formed near the North China Block.","[Tokiwa, Tetsuya; Shimosato, Shinji; Mori, Hiroshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan; [Shimura, Yusuke; Takeuchi, Makoto; Yamamoto, Koshi] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Tokiwa, T (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Fac Sci, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, Nagano 3908621, Japan.",tokiwa@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,,,,82,0,0,3,3,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1367-9120,1878-5786,,J ASIAN EARTH SCI,J.

Then, these boron-doped single-walled carbon nanotubes (B-SWCNTs) were added to polyurethane to prepare polyurethane nanocomposites having excellent thermal and mechanical properties. Changes in properties that occurred due to structural changes inside the composite were investigated as the added amount of nanofiller was increased. In particular, a near-infrared (NIR) laser (808 nm) was directly irradiated on the nanocomposite film to induce photothermal properties on the surface of the B-SWCNTs. In the case of the PU nanocomposite film with a filler content of 3 wt%, a self-heating film material that rapidly heated to 250 degrees C within 10 s was developed. The newly developed material can be applied to electronic devices and products as a heat-generating coating material, de-icing of airplane, a heat sink, for bio-sensing, etc., using a moulding process.","[Ha, Yu-Mi; Kim, Young-O; Kim, Young-Nam; Kim, Jaewoo; Jung, Yong Chae] KIST, Inst Adv Composite Mat, 92 Chudong Ro, Bongdong Eup 55324, Jeonbuk, South Korea; [Ha, Yu-Mi; Lee, Jae-Suk] GIST, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 123 Cheomdangwagi Ro, Gwangju 61005, South Korea; [Cho, Jae Whan] Konkuk Univ, Dept Organ & Nano Syst Engn, Seoul 05029, South Korea; [Endo, Morinobu; Muramatsu, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Global Aqua Innovat Ctr, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Endo, Morinobu; Muramatsu, Hiroyuki] Shinshu Univ, Inst Carbon Sci & Technol, Fac Engn, Nagano 3808553, Japan; [Kim, Yoong Ahm] Chonnam Natl Univ, Sch Polymer Sci & Engn, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 61186, South Korea","Jung, YC (reprint author), KIST, Inst Adv Composite Mat, 92 Chudong Ro, Bongdong Eup 55324, Jeonbuk, South Korea.; Lee, JS (reprint author), GIST, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, 123 Cheomdangwagi Ro, Gwangju 61005, South Korea.",jslee@gist.ac.kr; ycjung@kist.re.kr,"Kim, Young-O/AAG-7841-2019","kim, yoong ahm/0000-0003-4074-7515","KIST Institutional ProgramKorea Institute of Science & Technology (KIST); KAKENHIMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [18K04697]","This work was supported by the KIST Institutional Program.

We examined the impact of inpatient CR on disability and prognosis in patients with ADHF. Methods: A total of 171 patients admitted for ADHF underwent CR that included resistance training and aerobic exercise. Patient disability was evaluated using Barthel Index (BI) scores at pre-(BIpre) and post-(BIpost) rehabilitation. All-cause mortality was retrospectively recorded after discharge. Results: In the study cohort (median age: 76 years), 46 patients experienced all-cause mortality during a median of 478 days of follow-up. Impaired BIpost (i.e., BI < 60) was significantly correlated with older age and lower albumin, hemoglobin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, impaired BIpre and BIpost were significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Better outcomes were observed for improved BI (Delta BI > 15) among patients with impaired baseline BI. BIpost was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjusting for age, sex, eGFR, BNP, hemoglobin, albumin, and left ventricular ejection fraction. Conclusions: Inpatient CR led to improvements in disabilities among patients with ADHF. Baseline disabilities were associated with a poor prognosis. Greater improvements in BI to inpatient CR were significantly related to better outcomes in patients with impaired baseline BI. CR should be indicated for patients with ADHF. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated gC1qR expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and its pathophysiologic correlates in a surgical patient cohort. Methods: Tissue microarrays comprising 6 tumoral and 3 stromal cores from 265 patients with MPM (216 epithelioid, 26 biphasic, and 23 sarcomatoid; 1989-2010) were investigated by immunohistochemistry for gC1qR expression (intensity and distribution by H-score, range 0-300), and immune cell infiltration. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method (high vs. low gC1qR expression delineated by median score) in the whole cohort and by neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) status. Multivariable Cox analysis included stage, chemotherapy, and immune cell infiltration. Results: gC1qR was overexpressed in all histological types of MPMs (263/265, 99.2%) compared to normal pleura. In epithelioid MPM, high gC1qR expression was associated with better OS (median 25 vs. 11 months; p = 0.020) among NAC patients, and among patients without NAC (No-NAC) but who received post-operative chemotherapy (median OS 38 vs. 19 months; p = 0.0007). In multivariable analysis, high gC1qR expression was an independent factor for improved OS in patients treated with NAC. In the No-NAC cohort, high gC1qR expression correlated with lower tumor stage. Moreover, the influence of Ki67 and CD4 T-cell infiltration on OS were more pronounced among patients with high gC1qR expression. Conclusion: This is the first description of gC1qR expression in MPM. The data identify gC1qR as a potential new prognostic factor in patients treated with surgery and chemotherapy.","[Li, Xiaoyu; Eguchi, Takashi; Aly, Rania G.; Chintala, Navin K.; Adusumilli, Prasad S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Surg, Thorac Serv, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Li, Xiaoyu] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Dept Thorac Oncol, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Eguchi, Takashi] Shinshu Univ, Dept Surg, Div Thorac Surg, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan; [Aly, Rania G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Pathol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Aly, Rania G.] Alexandria Univ, Dept Pathol, Alexandria, Egypt; [Tan, Kay See] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Epidemiol & Biostat, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Zauderer, Marjorie G.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, Div Solid Tumor Oncol, Thorac Oncol Serv, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Dembitzer, Francine R.; Beasley, Mary Beth] Mt Sinai Sch Med, Dept Pathol, New York, NY USA; [Ghebrehiwet, Berhane] SUNY Stony Brook, Sch Med, Dept Med, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Adusumilli, Prasad S.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ctr Cell Engn, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Peerschke, Ellinor I.

Different contents of plasticizer dibutyl adipate (DBA) was added to TPU to swell its molecular chains and allowed them to pass through each other easily. These samples were then sandwiched between two electrodes as actuators and their actuation abilities were investigated. The results showed that the largest deflection among those samples was up to 12.11 mm, which corresponds to 48.44% of the length of samples (at 2.86 V mu m(-1)). The deflection increased with increasing of the electric field intensity. Besides, the actuator was able to promptly respond to the change of voltage within 0.12 s. A wide response ability in the frequency region from 0.5 Hz to 10 Hz was confirmed, and the largest amplitude over 22 mm of the actuator was observed at 5 Hz. Furthermore, a new method was proposed in this paper to estimate the tiny force generated by the actuator. The small variation (less than 3%) of the measured results indicated that the proposed method is reliable even at a small bending angle. It is believed that the rapid bending capability and large deformation of the developed actuator at low intensity of electric field will make its considerable contributions to the field of soft robotics or biomaterials.","[Li, Chongchao] Shinshu Univ, Grad Sch Med Sci & Technol, Smart Mat Sci & Technol Unit, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan; [Xia, Hong; Ni, Qing-Qing] Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan; [Yao, Juming; Ni, Qing-Qing] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Coll Mat & Text, Hangzhou 310018, Zhejiang, Peoples R China","Ni, QQ (reprint author), Shinshu Univ, Dept Mech Engn & Robot, 3-15-1 Tokida, Ueda, Nagano 3868576, Japan.",niqq@shinshu-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for the Shinshu University Advanced Leading Graduate Program by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), Japan.",,32,2,2,22,22,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0032-3861,1873-2291,,POLYMER,Polymer,10-Oct,2019,180,,,,,,,,UNSP 121678,10.1016/j.polymer.2019.121678,,,7,Polymer Science,Polymer Science,JG1WJ,WOS:000491867800014,,,,,2020/4/20
